I believe that free hosting is best hosting. The website will never need to be renewed and always be available for the community to get information about Electra. I believe using a .weebly domain has no correlation with scamming. It is not my intent to scam the crypto community as you will see the day the source code is released on April 2.

I have come across many altcoins with very professional websites that have shut down. There are even some active altcoins listed on coinmarketcap that no longer maintain websites.

Electra01 
March 30, 2017, 01:58:27 PM

I can guarantee that the 1,000,000,019 ECA won't enter the market before the real reward. Putting the pre-mine on the market would be a very bad strategy on my part and would kill Electra before it even reaches the Super Rewards Bonanza stage. If you are skeptical you are free to wait and come to mine later when the real reward kicks in.


The pre-mine will be used for, but not limited to, projects that improve accessibility, reliability and usage of Electra. A summary of them can be found in the OP listed under "Objectives".

I believe this guy may be attempting to try to discourage others to mine Electra so he can claim a larger portion of the Super Rewards Bonanza for himself. There will be many more like him. The status of the pre-mine can be easily tracked at anytime in Electra's block explorer.

"dump and leave with btc" is not part of my plans.

Electra01
April 01, 2017, 12:12:16 PM

I see your point. As I predicted, there will be uncertainty and tension between myself and potential miners for the first 40 days and I understand that. I believe though, that trust will increase every day I do not sell the pre-mine and when close to the Super Rewards Bonanza, there will be a lot more participants. My reasons for the low block rewards during the first 40 days are clearly stated in the OP. You also seem to have missed the fact that close to 19 billion Electra will be POW mined in 24 hours on day 40, reducing the share of the pre-mine to about 5% of the 20 billion ECA that will exist at that point.

0.003 per block is too low to attract (and keep) hashing power for 40 days. (I do not hate this project so consider this as a friendly comment) 


Electra01
April 02, 2017, 05:58:28 PM
The early 40 days will have a hard time with the hash rate but I believe it will slowly progress as there is an expectation at the end of it. I'll connect a few computers to it on Monday to help the chain progress if it continues like this.

April 03, 2017, 09:12:59 AM
Diff is very volatile so far. Miners with both high and low hash rates have come to try out the Electra network. If I remember, this is your first time at mining yes? At least you have practiced and know what to do when the big bonuses arrive. I suggest you also try and join a pool as practice because when the Super Rewards Bonanza arrives I predict the difficulty will spike and solo miners will have a tougher time.

Electra01
April 03, 2017, 06:21:32 PM
Roadmap is in the OP.

It is not a wallet test. Wallets have been tested. Block rewards are low at the moment to allow miners to fine-tune their equipment, setup pools, spread the word, experiment with transactions and solve issues they come across in preparation for the Super Rewards Bonanza stage. I believe the rate of participation and distribution can be relatively better this way.

I plan to get listed at least one exchange after block 500 is passed. Electra's code was purposefully written to be compatible with the requirements of all mainstream cryptocurrency exchanges.

April 13, 2017, 10:51:38 AM
Hello Gradius, I have updated the announcement section of the OP with the following:

There have been issues with Electra's difficulty retarget and, because of this, the blocks are getting mined at about half the rate they are supposed to be mined. These past few days, I have been considering whether to fork Electra OR leave it be and instead update the OP + website. I have decided to NOT fork Electra but by doing so, at the current rate, the super blocks are expected to arrive in day 80 rather than day 40 and the Super Rewards Bonanza may take 48 hours rather than 24. When POS begins, difficulty retarget be an issue. Therefore as this issue is temporary, it is not worth a fork in my opinion. If you agree/disagree let me know in the thread.

Due contemplating whether I should fork or not, I postponed the Yobit application until the upcoming weekend. Note that after I apply, it may also take another week for the exchange to add Electra. The OP will also be updated soon to avoid confusion.

An upstart exchange has contacted me saying that they voluntarily added Electra and even put buy orders in exchange for Dogecoin. If you need to buy/sell ECA, check out this link:

I have same problem



Electra01
May 12, 2017, 11:10:12 AM	

This has happened to me before and I solved it using the following method:

Change the name of the folder containing the Electra-qt wallet in it. It is by default called Electra when unzipped from Electra.zip. Change Electra to Electra j or any other name you want and reopen the wallet after the folder name change and it connects. Let me know if this works for you guys.

This did not solve the problem!

That way miner would mine the coin just for the super blocks...

Now, all the miners will flood the pool when the super blocks kick in and leave after...

Windows 10 protector app defender has removed Electra qt wallet ( not appdata files ) as malware ? Anybody else has same result ?




Electra01
May 31, 2017, 12:46:38 PM	

I am aware of this issue and it has been stated in the OP since launch day. Bitdefender also has the same issue. It is very irregular that Virustotal result marks Microsoft and Bitdefender as safe yet such problems are experienced. This is something I am prioritizing to fix in the first update package. I suggest you try uploading the Electra-qt file to Virustotal yourself if you want to be assured the wallet is clean. For now the only way to prevent the Electra-qt from being deleted is to add it as an exception in your anti-virus program.



GreenDefender

Electra01
June 02, 2017, 09:55:38 AM	

The update package will be released when the number of active and consistent nodes increase significantly. I also need to observe how Electra performs during the POS stage. It will not be released within the next 3 months even if the nodes increase because I will be focusing on some of Electra's medium term goals stated in the OP. In other words, there is no set date for release yet.

It may not be that quick. Due to diff retarget problem about 100 blocks finish a day.

For "user" you do not need to put your wallet address. Pick whatever word you like to replace both "user" and "pass".

Example:

listen=1
daemon=1
server=1
rpcuser=cheese
rpcpassword=jelly
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcport=5788
addnode=217.77.59.45:5817
addnode=93.115.61.93:5817
addnode=94.23.102.99:5817
addnode=52.41.97.84:5817


AND make sure you use same user and pass for command prompt:
sgminer.exe -k nist5 -o http://127.0.0.1:5788 -u cheese -p jelly

Launched CCminer from command line. Claims that I have 29.45 MH/s.

However I'm not sure how to see if I got something or not. And the network is still slow, with 3 active connections and 9 blocks remaining. The strange thing is: when it was stuck before, I just reopened the wallet and it downloaded around 400 blocks before freezing again. After that I've done the same thing multiple times downloading some blocks and closing the wallet as soon as it froze.

However it doesn't seem to work as I have 9 blocks remaining. Weird.

As far as I understand these issues are due to the lack of active connections. My .conf contains all the nodes I've found in this thread.

I see a problem with this Bonanza staking. Let me explain this: some days before i was able with my Geforce GTX 960 ( around 8 Mh/s )
create 2-3 blocks per hour to both my wallet or to ECA-pool. Nethash rate was around 15 Mh/s and diff around 2.

Today in pre bonanza phase nethash rate is around 767 Mh/s with a diff of around 78.  Eca-pool holds 10% hashpower

Monday (?) at bonaza phase big chinese miners will point their power to ECA blockchain. Result: mininig to your own wallet is useless , mining over ECA-pool can be useless too, because 90% (or more) Electra coins will travel to china

marimbadude
June 10, 2017, 03:01:16 PM	

I kinda agree with you, however I don't see a reason why China should pay attention to Electra at this point.

Everybody IMPORTANT Announcement

The value for circulating supply on Coinmarketcap is not updating even though I gave them Electra's block explorer URL. It is stuck on 43. If it updated properly Electra, with the current price, would be in the top 10 right now.

I need everyone who can to message Gliss or write to Coinmarketcap and let this concern be known. A top 10 ranking would do a great deal for Electra giving it much more recognition. More recognition leads to more volume and a sustainable cryptocurrency.

Electra's value for circulating and total supply on Coinmarketcap is not updating. It is stuck on 43.

Our current real-time price:

1385416706.99 * $61.65 = $85 billion


We would currently top Coinmarketcap if the circulating supply value updates. I have no idea why it is stuck at 43. I promise you a Bittrex or Poloniex listing will happen if Coinmarketcap can fix this in time. We have actually become the first cryptocurrency to pass Bitcoin's market cap but nobody can see it!!

The real price will be definitely lower than this. That price (61.65$) is for very low reward state which is finished now.

Only .24BTC in buy orders on the market.   Those people who left buys in are going to be sad when these coins actually hit exchange wallets and get sold.

Just because you have a price now doesn't mean it is going to sustain that after you release another 19 billion coins.   I'd guess the price will be  $0.0000000153 if the current price stands.  45/19000000000 * $65

We'll see though..

43 ECA is circulating according to Coinmarketcap. It is the value from 2 days ago.

Electra01
If the circulating supply in Coinmarketcap gave real-time value as it is supposed to, we would CURRENTLY be #1. What the price becomes after the superblocks I don't know. But a #1 spot on Coinmarketcap would help.

A lot of confirmations block needed.


Jaerin
June 13, 2017, 08:55:29 PM	

LOL yeah right people became richer than Bill Gates.  Someone has no clue how dilution of coins or stocks work.  You can't split your stock shares and tell everyone they just doubled their money.  The price always splits right along with the stock split.  The same thing happens here.

65 coins -> 20 billion means the price splits 19999999935 times right along with it.  So that $120 price becomes $0.0000000006 per share.

Also imagine that someone publishing an article written and paid for by the coin creator and of course it must be true.   Someone will take your money and post something online, that is a fact.  No amount of disclaimers is going to change the fact that it was still written and paid for by a totally biased source.  This is like a Trump style liefest in here.  It's like you drank your own kool-aid and now are seeing things that no one else can see.

The pool is down because PoW stage is completely over, now it is POS 100% stage, if I remember correctly someone said it takes like 432 confirmations to get your unconfirmed to confirmed to sent to your wallet. I have no idea why it is that high and maybe the OP can expand on that, but I personally don't mind waiting.

Is there any way to tune down the needed confirmations??? 400+ confirmations required would at that point take days, weeks to get everything from the pool (for everyone) to get to the wallets, then an additional 400+ confs required to go unconfirmed in the wallet to confirmed.

If that was the fact, I would call CenturyLink, Comcast, Xfinity, Verizon, Cricket, AT&T, etc etc etc a scammer because people have troubles with them ALLLLLLLLLL the time.... Heck, Verizon just raised my bill $30 for NO reason, and after 3 days of blowing up in their faces, they finally realized it was their mistake and credited me $100 off my next bill.

ALL coins mined currently during the bonanza are unconfirmed, because they need 400+ block confirmations
until they are valid/released. The issue the Dev is working on now is that nobody has any coins to stake, so no blocks are being mined,
so nobody is receiving their coins (which they need to stake). Essentially, the block chain is stuck while Electra01 works on it.
Worry not, you'll receive your coins!


Jaerin

June 14, 2017, 04:25:01 AM	
It's not a bug, its obvious manipulation of a system that Electra obviously doesn't understand.  Just because a price was one thing today if you add 19 billion coins the price doesn't stay the same.  The second the coins actually hit a wallet that could sell the price would have been gone.  You guys act like the daily volume of the coin doesn't matter.  It's not just a simple 1 coin sold for $120 therefore all 19 billion coins are worth $120 each.  Market dilution is a very basic economic idea.

http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diluted-normalized-earnings-per-share.asp

You issue more shares or release more coins and the price per coin goes down unless someone puts more money in to raise the price back up.  Most beginners in trading know more than what has been demonstrated here.

Hey Dev, to assist in mining some blocks, how about forwarding a bunch of coins to those with Electra addresses to assist with mining via wallet staking. This will speed up the process and keep the doubters at bay. The coins can be returned afterwards.

Electra01
June 14, 2017, 02:23:56 PM	
Don't worry guys I am working on it. The fast solution is 99% going to involve a hard fork. I will also be adding new seed nodes while I am at it.


IF the hard fork does not happen, the scenario below will happen:

Right now, there seems to be only about 4-6 people with confirmed ECA in their wallet. By block 11880, about 20-30 people will have confirmed ECA for staking as there were some people mining 150 blocks before the bonanza. I estimate it will take about 16-17 days to reach block 11880 if the 4-6 people stake daily. When the next 20-30 people, assuming they transferred some ECA from the pool to their wallets get confirmed, the next block where many people will be confirmed is 11950. Block 11950 will take 4 days to reach if everyone who became confirmed on block 11880 stake daily. After that confirmed ECA in wallets will be in the 100s and things will move much faster. Everyone remaining can get their ECA within 1-2 days. This scenario is based on many assumptions and I believe a fork would be a much better solution.


Keep in mind that this kind of distribution of coins was never tried before and it was hard to anticipate while originally designing some parameters how many people would be using the coin before the Bonanza and after it.

Jaerin
June 14, 2017, 03:47:55 PM	

No it seemed like you just had no clue how to design a coin and plan for your actual end of your bonanza.   You didn't seem to think about how the confirmations would work at all and made gross assumptions about how websites like coinmarketcap would just ignore the market dilution and put you at #1 even though it is obvious that would never have happened.  Then you went and paid $300 to write an article trying to claim that Electra was #1 market cap coin knowing that it wasn't even possible because all your coins are locked in the blockchain.  How about a little admission of your clearly lacking any real knowledge of how this was supposed to actually work.  Now you're doing the research that should have been done before the coin was released and someone is telling you how you might fix it.  Dead coin is dead.  No market worth anything is going to trust this coin for anything but a useless failed gimmick.

Lol we can take this oportunity to swap coins   and lunch a new blockchain and wallet. POS + a reduction from 30.000.000.000 to 30 millions coins. Or we wait for a better solution.






minerja
June 14, 2017, 05:14:02 PM	

I'm happy to wait 30days +, not in any rush, and why should we lose millions of coins cos a few people want to try to make a few bucks?

Besides, if you look at nova, there's only orders for around 500k eca, so whoever manages to get their coin confirmed on there first, will clean house, and unless anyone else wants to trade then its game over...
So i say let the stakers stake, lets see it unfold, DEV if you can lower pool payout to 0.0001 eca, that will help many more peeps get some eca out, which in turn will help move things along....or...let us mine another 432 blocks at 0 payout...
my best guess is, if you hard fork it, we all lose....

I have coins in my personal wallet... I am one of the 3 or 4 that do... however they will not stake... it says I am staking and showing me a weight but I have yet to create a block or stake anything... I saw this coming as any normal person should have... everyone and their mom was mining directly to Nova and no one had personal wallets open, so I made 5 small inputs into my personal wallet as soon as I could knowing that with no one having anything in a person wallet no one could stake and move the chain... With those 5 inputs in my wallet I should be able to stake 5 times depending on how long those coins are held up in the stake... Like I said though, my wallet has been open for a long time and it still hasn't created a block.

Just hard fork it back to block 11810 and do no reward POW, then u can use a raspberry pi to move the chain or whatever without spending a lot of resources.

Dev, I think it would be nice to stay in touch with the community and update more often on the current state of affairs. Silence is dangerous when it comes to blockchain problems.


Knathein
June 15, 2017, 06:08:52 PM	

I have been in contact with Electra01 the dev, He said that "I have realized at the current state, since a hard fork requires the blocks to progress, which they can't, this approach won't work." and as a result of that, as of right now it seems like he is going to re-enable POW mining for a while with 0 block rewards, and encourage people to create multiple staking addresses so when the POS switch does happen again, everyone with all the millions of coins will be staking dozens of times per day. He states that the ETA on that is 1 to 2 weeks, no ECA will be lost in this process, everyone just hops on the network again and mine until the "Bonanza" stage gets through.

I will try to keep updated as well and see if we can't get the "ETA" sooner.

Hope this helps 

EDIT: Another thing I forgot to mention is he was also playing with the idea of when it goes to the POS stage again, making the stake times between 10 and 60 minutes, so that way it will truly be "dozens" of times per day each address that is staked across the network. This is all of the updated information that I have so far for now, but I will talk to him and see if he can't give an update from himself/post something on the OP. As I can tell though he is trying to work out the kinks as hard as he can.

Don't see how you can call it a scam when nobody really 'lost' anything of value. It's a new coin.
We get it, you think he's a scammer, you don't need to repost 3 times to get your point across. So leave.

Ever think maybe he's *busy*?

Jaerin

June 17, 2017, 05:27:28 PM	
People lost about 2 days of mining power into this super bonanza and ended up getting nothing at all in return.  If the dev has a plan to fix it why does it take 2 weeks to implement?

It's a scam because it was based on a failed premise of being #1 market cap based on the price of 45 coins turning into 20 billion without any kind of dilution of the market.  It was just a gimmick to try and trick the market cap websites into acting like this coin is some how legit by manipulating a formula that the dev couldn't even understand.


joder
June 17, 2017, 06:21:44 PM	

While a solution is found, the POS should be working.

Well it can not work because there are only two active nodes and the wallets never sync

The dev says there are not enough wallets with money.
Well he should create 100 accounts of windows or ubuntu and create each one a wallet. Deposit 1 ECA, synchronize, return master nodes and finally put them in POS mode

The dev has 1000000019 ECA in his wallet, obtained in block 3 of POW
https://cryptobe.com/chain/Electra?hi=19&count=20

joder
June 17, 2017, 06:30:15 PM	

And if for some reason did not have them, and it was a mistake the 1000000019 ECA, he has also mined 11,521 blocks so he must have more than 1000 ECA



marimbadude
June 17, 2017, 06:31:11 PM	

The market cap thing was not the meta idea of the coin, as I understood. Correct me if I'm wrong.

I agree about the mining days, however I don't consider anything a loss yet. If dev will abandon Electra and the chain will be stuck forever with pool disappearing into the void then yes, it was a scam. Now it's just work in progress. Yes it takes a long time, it's not pleasant to see the block 1816 topping the block explorer (days after bonanza). But at the same time dev has nowhere to dump coins, the chain is still and the only scammy thing dev can possibly do is taking coins that are not worth anything much as well as poorly working blockchain, getting backlash from the community. So it's not worth it (in my opinion).

Knathein
June 17, 2017, 09:00:37 PM	

Man you are so salty that you have to create a brand new account and spam this thread???

SURELY, if you know how ANYTHING works, that changing things, coding/programming, etc, TAKES TIME... I mean... I don't know about you, but he isn't someone like Microsoft and Blizzard Entertainment that has 5000+ employees and can fix something in the blink of an eye. Surely, if you go out of your way to link several things, then copy and paste it in a double post, you would know that a 1 man team of a crypto coin would take some time and energy out of his day that he may have a full time job to fix something that went bad.

Right now it's still under work, I am sure that you would know that if you were to create a cryptocoin all by yourself, you would rather be focused on getting a problem fixed AND know that it would take a long time to fix if you are by yourself, right?

micdvd85
June 18, 2017, 07:39:27 AM	

As I originally said one page back, this happened because everyone mined directly from the pool to their Novaexchange addresses, not one person stopped to think "Oh hey, maybe I should deposit into my own person address so that when it switches to POS only, there will be something to stake." That is why there is only 2 wallets open, one being the exchange and one being mine, I was apparently the only one who saw this coming and made sure to make deposits into my own person wallet so that there would be something to stake and hopefully move the chain. Everyone only cares about their coins being in the exchange so they can sell them, and that mindset is why there isn't any stakeable coins to move the chain.



minerja
June 18, 2017, 08:27:12 AM	

micdvd85 would you mind not speaking for me...

You know nothing about how i mined this coin.
How i had  mined it for weeks before the superblocks, or how i was mining the superblocks direct to my wallet....

The simple fact is, the dev didnt think this through, probably from lack of experience....
I have left my wallet open many hours, but since it wont sync, not really a lot i can do to help....

I don't know if its a scam coin but its definitely broken and your not helping.
Anyway, lets see hope he can fix it, i doubt it makes much difference anymore to be honest....even if he gets it working i think we simply ended up with full wallets that no-one wants to trade....lets wait and see

micdvd85
June 18, 2017, 08:30:11 AM

Jaerin
June 20, 2017, 02:24:32 AM	

Diversification has nothing to do with this.  No one is saying that this cost anyone other than a couple days of mining power.  The point is the dev didn't think through how their coin was going to actually have to work before asking people to trust him.

Now they are silent on the issue which is never a good sign.  If the coins come through great just means that they'll get dumped on the market and the rest will sit around until someone decided to try and use this as an investment vehicle, which I doubt anyone will.

Then again maxcoin was listed on Yobit and that is a known scam coin.

the previous versions, v110 and v111, will become an issue when the chain actually hits block 18116,
which will be in approx 6 weeks,
they will reject the real chain.

there is no 432 confirmations in the src. no idea where that came from.







zeus1984
June 23, 2017, 11:05:18 AM	

coin is dead, unfortunately 
My 69 million coins have not been confirmed on the pool and now they simply do not exist.
Blockexplorer froze on 11816 block

Download the new wallet, we are currently at block 11936. Don't use the cryptobe at this moment, use this instead:https://eca.acc-pool.pw/index.php?page=statistics&action=blocks.
Coins still need confirmation.

octavarium
June 23, 2017, 12:09:45 PM	

so, if we update and coin received from pool
we wait nova update wallet, right !!
reality drama..

FulcruM
on line 811 of the main.cpp
ode:
int CMerkleTx::GetBlocksToMaturity() const
{
    if (!(IsCoinBase() || IsCoinStake()))
        return 0;
    return max(0, (nCoinbaseMaturity+422) - GetDepthInMainChain());
}

so at the beginning of main.cpp, nCoinbaseMaturity defined as 10, but then there is this + 422

check https://eca.acc-pool.pw/index.php?page=statistics&action=blocks

it says 432 confirmations needed. This was the whole problem why the coin got stuck in the first place imo. I might be wrong tho

zeus1984

How i can update walet in pool?
I used pool.coin-miners.info, when i mined bonanza blocks.

marimbadude
June 23, 2017, 01:09:03 PM	

Oh my bad, I didn't read the message in a right way!But well, download the new wallet anyways, chain is moving steadily.

bumbacoin
June 23, 2017, 01:11:29 PM	
well there you go, 432 confirmations indeed .. very strange.
it certainly doesnt help with moving coins.

when i advised extending PoW i was not aware of it,
i mean i saw in thread the mention but could find no obvious trace of it ...  that adds nearly two days o_O

i will have to give that further consideration and liaise with dev.

markus124
June 23, 2017, 03:41:34 PM	
Looks like novaexchange is in the old chain. The pool probably is blocking the withdraw request to prevent people lost coins if u had an old address. Update your exchange and wallet address at the pool.


marimbadude
June 23, 2017, 04:07:07 PM	

Hey, if I had a small amount of coins in my wallet before downloading the new wallet and I update the pool withdrawal address to the same that I had before, will I get my coins? I know that the question is weird, but I have such situation for the first time so I'm making sure that it's gonna be alright.

EuroLine
June 23, 2017, 04:12:27 PM	

Probably yeah.

Jaerin
June 23, 2017, 04:19:57 PM	

Super bonanza blocks have started to become fully confirmed and crediting the pool accounts with the coins.

I would make sure your payout wallet address is correct because it looks like it is doing autopayouts and there isn't an option on the pool to disable them entirely.  Even the high amount is only 250,000 so it will likely trigger.

EuroLine
June 23, 2017, 04:20:52 PM

Hey guys I'm new at mining and I have a little bit of questions, after a while of research my doubts are primarly, what are the Nodes for and how do we use them?

And according to the pool... I have like 1,800 coins paidout, this means I made like 30k USD (At 20 USD each) out of almost nowhere or I'm missing something?

Thank you guys

markus124
June 23, 2017, 05:35:20 PM	

yes they change the number of confirmations only 10 and you can get ur coins available to spend.


markus124
June 23, 2017, 05:40:42 PM	
1-Sometime ur wallet doesnt sync and you need to create a list of nodes to connect it. You go to the appdata file and create a file with the list of nodes so you can sync the wallet. Looks like this
2- You will only get that money if theres enough liquidity in the market. When people moves electra coin to the exchange the value will drop.


marimbadude

Dev, when do you list eca to another exchandes?
And how do you solve the problem with novaexchange (there is not updated wallet)?

FulcruM
June 23, 2017, 06:46:15 PM	

When you get or send coins to someone it needs only 10 confirmations to be usable. However, mined blocks needs to be confirmed 432 times, still.

Novaexchange has a note about limited support due to Swedish holiday.  It will likely have to wait for them to come back.

2017-06-23 09:36 - Limited support until Monday

All swedes are celebrating Swedish midsummer (https://youtu.be/u8ZLpGOOA1Q) so the support will be limited until Monday June 26


marimbadude
June 23, 2017, 07:04:19 PM	

Agree. I think Bittrex would be very interested in Electra, especially POS. However I do beilieve that after the next completed roadmap stage, Electra will have to extend the roadmap further. And at the moment we can't do anything about Nova - holidays.

Always encrypted wallet.  Preferably cold storage, but that likely isn't possible right now.  Best to have multiple backups of your encrypted wallets.

The wallet hasn't been updated to the new version yet.  Novaexchange admins are on vacation until next week and so it likely won't be updated until then.

epicfailman
June 23, 2017, 10:22:05 PM	
Dev, what about Bittrex?
When POW blocks left, ECA will be good coin for Bittre

FulcruM
calculate friend.

If you mined at 11522 that means your coins will start confirming at 11522+432 which is 11954.
And last of them will be confirmed at 11810+432 which is 12242.

marimbadude
June 23, 2017, 10:59:18 PM	
Yes, yes, yes, Bittrex loves PoS. We should make it a priority exchange.

Everyone,

Due to the help provided by the bumbacoin dev in creating the new wallets, he has been sent 20,000,000 ECA from the pre-mine account. I mentioned this would happen previously in the email sent to you all by the pool manager. The bumbacoin developer's help was highly significant as his contribution saved Electra from a very difficult situation. This payment also means that a very talented developer has become a stakeholder in Electra who has an interest in making this cryptocurrency better for all.

FulcruM
June 24, 2017, 10:16:51 PM	

if they somehow backup wallet.dat for every user, you'll get your coins and it is a reliable site, this should be the way.


bumbacoin
June 25, 2017, 03:06:49 AM	

great,
I am splitting it up into bite size chunks for staking.

we're still a few days away from the end of PoW,
and with the distribution of funds it looks like the transition to PoS should be much smoother this time.

block times will probably be a bit jerky for a while until all the staking wallets split a dozen times or so.

Knathein
June 25, 2017, 03:29:38 AM	

This may be a silly idea but is anyone good enough to make a dice site with possible investing? Just a suggestion, I am not a good enough coder/programmer to do that, but something simple could be kinda fun to get a few people into it while we wait for Nova to get the ball rolling, and get a roadmap underway  



Jaerin
June 25, 2017, 05:07:20 AM	
So that's means we should split the wallet multiple times if we have a significant amount of coins?  If so any recommendation of maximum staking size?

When the extended PoW stage ends.


epicfailman
June 25, 2017, 06:00:58 PM	

Dev, what about next steps?
I think we need to repair block explorer first.
If we want normal price for ECA, Bittrex we be good choice (if you need enchanced account for addding new coin, i have it). Coinexchange will be good too.
We need MacOS wallet. What about bounty for developing?
After end of last POW blocks, there is good time for signature/twitter/facebook bounties.
Will be good idea to create "starting" video and host it on YouTube (making wallet, making exchange account, trading, withdraw, etc).

bumbacoin
June 26, 2017, 03:28:46 AM	
if you split large inputs into multiple chunks, that will help the transition to PoS.

staking is currently working, make sure you've updated to latest wallet v112

my first impression seems incorrect.

log1k

432 blocks until funds can be spend, mined or pos.
thats more than likely the reason behind the chain seizing up initially; as there were little/no mature funds to stake with.

There seem to have been a hard fork for Electra so there is now two wallets on different height.

given the volume; it could only have been either dev or bumbacoin, because theyd been running the chain privately for some time.

bumbacoin
June 26, 2017, 10:29:30 AM	

lol.
the chain has been public since before anyone could move coins. no opportunity for private chain shenanigans.

not to suggest zeus had anything to do with anything, but it seems they've had access to their "super rewards bonanza", so it could be anyone .
and looking at the btc/eca page on nova it seems like only a few million coins were needed to have done the carnage evident.

please dont accuse anyone without proper thought, thank you.

It could have been anyone.With a r9 390 and only maybe 8 hours of mining i got more than 1.5kk coins.Imagine someone that used a cloud miner,or 6-7 gpu for 2 days.Also i believe that both dev and bumbacoin are interested to gain much more than 0.1 btc.Today any coin can reach 1-2 million market cap,if it is supported a bit,and this mean a value 20 times higher.Let's be serious,a marketcap of 23 btc(at 1 satoshi)it's too low for a new coin that is still alive.

i can not find it with that name at least

Hi Any particular reason u need that miner? Are you trying to mine ECA? If so what hardware? I'll help if i can.


bumbacoin
June 26, 2017, 01:15:13 PM	
there is honestly no point in trying to mine ECA now,
by the time POW finishes there is the possibility of mining 815 coins, if you got all the blocks left ...

at the current value, they are worth less than 1 satoshi

People dumping at 1 sat are miners, who want the quick return. Can you blame them though? 2 day PoW wasted little to no electricity. Traders can pick this up at 1 sat and if they're willing to wait weeks/months it is easy to make a tonne of profit. It all depends on regular updates and development. Without it there would be no incentive for anyone to risk their money to move the market.

Any new exchange (Cryptopia, Coinexchange, Bittrex...) and ECA will rise. Now on Nova we have more than 10% of total amount. It is too much for one exchange. And so much coins with low price - result of cloud miners work. They want to return their money spent on renting.

or promote it on nova, like those coins up top over there. not sure how that works but it would at least expose it to new people.

marimbadude
June 27, 2017, 11:50:34 PM	
No offense to Nova, they are doing a great job, but they are much smaller than Bittrex. And the exposure wouldn't be significant, compared to Bittrex listing.

Anthrogic
June 29, 2017, 03:30:43 PM	
Actually much lower price than 1 satoshi. The price is about 0.015 DOGE asking price (bids are much lower), which is around 1/10 a satoshi.
Nobody is buying with BTC because DOGE price is 1/10 the BTC price (because its lower than a satoshi). So don't be expecting 1 satoshi+ anytime soon!

If you want to buy Electra, buy using DOGE, you'll get 10x more Electra than if you bid 1 satoshi with BTC.

bumbacoin
July 01, 2017, 04:03:22 AM	
i've sent the dev a PM regarding strange PoS payouts,

it seems a strange issue of code ordering, it looks fine but behaves as we see.
basically atm the expected reward is divided by 1000000

fixing it will require adjusting how the code works out stake rewards so it will need another fork.

.
a slight note in regard to how reward is calculated,
the min stake age is deducted from reward calculations,
so a payout after two days would be worked out minus 24 hours (min stake age), => payout would then be based on 1 day.

Shitty website despite the wonders why it is a weebly site, questionable beginnings and roadmap,.. This entire ELECTRA/ ECA stuff is obviously an entire scam.. The developer made a huge premine and dumped the whole bunch on exchanges and sold at exorbitant rates.. I only wonder where the conscience is. So many people lost so much to this scam and idiots who still choose to 'mine' really do not see that they are still being scammed by these ruthless criminals.. If you have the slightest bit of humanity in you, I think you would strive to do right by all those people who once believed in this enough to put some money into it.. Create a proper website and get some meaning and life to this through active and dedicated developers for a meaningful cause, and who knows what great things will come to you

If your intentions are good and your project real, we should be able to feel that engagement by mere visiting the site..

Electra has a big question mark on it and until the developers prove themselves through value delivery and visible progressive works it will remain tagged a scam work well orchestrated by a group of thoughtless, careless and ruthless individuals... I hope you find the self-love to do what's right in the face of humanity.

we're working on that now,

and because of the necessity of a fork we're just making sure this one will be the last one.

How is it a scamcoin?  The market controls the price so if you don't buy any then you can't get scammed.  You either are an investor in it or not just like dogecoin.

What is the future of dogecoin or any of the other hundreds of coins that seem to have no real purpose other than as an investment vehicle?

The original purpose of Dogecoin doesn't even exist anymore and yet it still continues to fluctuate in support and price.

IMPORTANT

This wallet was directly released to the thread by bumbacoin without me checking/testing it. I suggest that no one downloads the new wallet until bumbacoin explains why viruses were detected and sheds light on the issue. He has been a great contributor and I do trust him so it may be an honest mistake but for the time being DO NOT download. Thanks for being sharp a community everyone.

Electra01
July 05, 2017, 11:55:34 AM	

I think he will like this compliment. Out of 61 anti-virus programs, a virus only seems to be detected by Kaspersky so far. I have done a Bitdefender scan and the wallet came clean. However, from the perspective of an outside investor, it does not look good even if one antivirus in virustotal detects an infection so ideally it would be better if we get this fixed.


bitcamilo
July 05, 2017, 12:06:34 PM	
I have been supporting Electra since the beginning, but we must be skeptical for crypto world, there was no this situation in any version and this is a very suspicious situation, i am sure Bumbakoin will make a statement about this situation.

there should not be a trojan.

here's the virustotal for previous wallet

Why not upload it to virus-total and see what online malware checker says. Boombacoin, the guy has a record of posting non-stuff, drinking substances that are waste matter of a human body and other not so appropriate things that most of you would rather avoid. If he uploaded the malware it is the first sign of his soul ailment.



bumbacoin
July 05, 2017, 04:35:49 PM	
lol.
i think we all enjoy a good dose of idiocy from time to time. thanks for todays clown action.

,
but apart from your amusing outlook,
you'll see above there are links to virustotal,
it lists kapersky as finding an issue.

crypto wallets have a long and glorious history of triggering virus scans.

there are no virus or otherwise nefarious inclusions in the wallet releases by me.

please feel free to behave in a manner which makes you feel safe,


..
edit,
earlier i checked virustotal report for prior release (v1121) and thought i found similar virus report,
however now it's clear with v1121 showing no issues..
i'm tired and no idea what i was looking at :p

there is very little difference between code bases so i have no idea why kapersky decided to flag this version and not the other.

i can try to re-compile it tomorrow to see if it comes up different, i dont see why, but given the minor differences in code that trigger this report,
perhaps recompiling it will actually change the outcome.


Jaerin
July 05, 2017, 11:57:17 PM	
Did you increase the compression settings of the executable?  Usually any kind of compression or obfuscation will trigger these generic alerts.

As I recalled when I first scanned the new release when I downloaded it, it came up clean.

Now it is 2/61 detected for IRCBot

the recompile has changed it to create a new fingerprint.

Electra01
July 06, 2017, 03:14:32 AM	
I can confirm that the latest wallet v120 now has 0 detections in virustotal. After block 17100, the new wallet intends to:

1) Reduce the 432 block maturity to a lower value. The current value is causing the minimum stake age to be higher than 24 hours. The minimum stake age will now be 24 hours as originally designed.

2) Increase reward yields from staking to %50 for about a year; initially promised in the OP.

Electra01
July 06, 2017, 12:43:19 PM	

I also now see a problem with Kaspersky if re-analysed. Such an inconsistency existed in the first Electra wallet also: virustotal detected nothing yet my paid Bitdefender anti-virus saw it as a dangerous file and kept removing it. I have sent a message to virustotal about these inconsistencies. If they reply, I will share their answer in this thread.

We need to move forward. Everyone has access to the source code and maybe somebody can one day solve this issue. Coinsmarkets and Novaexchange have already adopted the new wallet. Novaechange have also re-opened the Litecoin-Electra exchange to enable arbitrage trading for Electra holders:

That's because it is listed on the DOGE, ESP2, and KIP exchanges which allowed the "price" to drop below 1 sat.  Not reason to buy for 1 sat when you can get them for for .00035 DOGE.  The price is fluctuating so there is a little trading activity.

Market cap did get up to about $300k USD, but has since fallen back down to $200k.  We'll see if we can get some traction on it.  It doesn't really offer a lot of features so not sure what is going to happen to make it compete against all the other coins out there.

fenn500
July 06, 2017, 10:14:41 PM	

It's where the real value of Electra was updated on Coinmarket.

It's wasn't updating ages ago and said there was 45 coins in circulation pushing the Cap way up. Then coins got stuck in the pools after the Super Bonaza Rewards stage, that got fixed and trading of millions of coins started.

Soon after the price dropped to 1 sat on Novaexchange, but Coinmarket went blank, showing only ?'s for circulation. Eventually it updated to the true value on the 2nd of July.

That's the drop you can see.

It is NOT being moved with the intention of selling. The full amount will be returned to a single address about a week after the hard fork occurs.

Electra01
July 07, 2017, 09:19:01 AM	

Livecoin voting is difficult. Each user gets 1 vote every 30 days. The top 3 currently each have 30,000+ votes. If we had 3000 active users in ECA it would still take us 10 months to reach the top 3. Entry by direct payment is easier for Livecoin. Voting is simply not worth pursuing.

bumbacoin
July 08, 2017, 01:13:17 PM	

once you've deposited coins into your wallet,
they will take around 1 day to become eligible for staking,

when they are eligible, when you leave your wallet open they will have a chance to generate a PoS block.

the chance is based on the size or your input (coin deposit) and it's age.
the bigger, the older, the more chance you have.

Electra01
July 08, 2017, 03:59:27 PM	

Do you have any active connections? If not, add nodes into the .conf file.

If you have connections, try restarting the wallet. If that does not work, you need to go to AppData/Roaming/Electra and delete everything EXCEPT wallet.dat and then re-open the wallet.


Electra01
July 08, 2017, 04:12:52 PM

You just need to open the Electra Wallet application with coins in it and let it run.  If you have encrypted your wallet you will need to unlock the wallet.  There is a checkbox to only unlock it for staking purposes.

please consider how much you value your crypto, if it's very very very important to you, then you should take extreme measures, which includes having a seperate system for your wallets

the greatest sense of security is only running it on a safe system.

Buy on the Doge market..

It's 6 time cheaper.

If you want to sell ECA you can't unless you want to sell under 1 Satoshi.

irustotal has sent a reply regarding the inconsistency of their scans for the lastest Electra wallet. The email correspondence has been shared below:


Me:

I shared a file with virustotal and in the initial scan it had a 0/61
detection ratio.

After the file was re-scanned it became 1/61 flagged by Kaspersky only.

After a few more recans the detection ration is at 7/61. Kaspersky no

Electra01
July 19, 2017, 01:24:08 PM	
Regarding masternodes:

Masternodes is an option I will consider after the 50% reward phase is over and Electra's POS rewards come from transaction fees only. This is because it is uncertain if, in the future, earning rewards from transaction fees ONLY will give people enough incentive to host a node. If in such a state Electra loses too many nodes OR if there is a democratic majority who wants the change, masternodes can be put in place as it may possibly boost the number of nodes.

There are a lot of arguments for and against masternodes and each may effect Electra's unique situation differently. I am not sure if there is currently any cryptocurrency in the world which has implemented masternodes + POS rewards from transaction fees only and therefore it is difficult to foresee how masternodes will fare in such a situation.

Electra01
July 19, 2017, 01:26:35 PM	

Regarding objectives:

All short term objectives are already completed. I aim to complete all medium term objectives within one year. I have begun speaking with exchanges only recently as I did not think it would have been a smart strategy to apply to an exchange before the hard fork. At the current state, the price is below 1 satoshi which will make it hard to maintain a Bitcoin-Electra trading pair in a larger exchange. We can get in sure, but why would someone buy ECA for 0.00000001 BTC in Bittrex when they can go to Novaexchange and buy it for 0.00000001 LTC. We would eventually get delisted for low volume.

There are other alternatives I am looking at for exchanges such as the Earthcoin strategy: even though they don't even have an active website and only $500 a day volume on Novaexchange, they have $5,000,000 of total daily volume and $13,000,000 market cap. How? The rest of the volume comes from two Chinese exchanges they are on. Focusing on the Chinese market seems an interesting choice to increase volume. Earthcoin does not seem to have done much marketing in Chinese either so I am very curious how they reached this kind of volume. If there is a Chinese speaker in the community, I would appreciate help for a Chinese market expansion as I do not speak the language. It would be good to know the price/criteria to get into exchanges like Jubi and BTC38. If there are no Chinese speakers, I will still research this alternative but it will just take longer.

I've asked about the wallet's CPU usage before, and someone replied that it's because staking requires CPU power.  That's fine.  But even when the wallet is offline it uses 9-12% CPU just for being open.  Why is this?  It should not be the case...

Unfortunately, I think it is hard to put an eca market on it because they said they will never put on a new altcoin on their web site.... As far as I know, they just put on the eth market a few days ago.... But, don't worry, there would be still a lot chinese market to choose~ BTW, maybe there would be few chinese people cause this website had been blocked by GFW(AKA great/government firewall). And, maybe I can help you to do some translation for website or client(coinname in your chinese client is wrong~).

first thing is to check they're on the blockchain,

https://cryptobe.com/chain/Electra

if they're not on the blockchain, delete your copy of the blockchain and resync from zero. (keep your wallet.dat safe !*!*!)

if they are on the blockchain, you'll need to lodge a support ticket with novexchange

i think something wrong with PoS, for 2 days there were 6 mined blocks, with an estimated time of 4.5 hours, I think it should have been more, 24 * 2/4.5 ~ 10.6 this is about 1.7 more times


"expectedtime" : 16241 /60/60 = 4.5
"weight" : 563820492,
"netstakeweight" : 30523685419,

30523685419/563820492~54 = 1\54  net weight

unsigned int nTargetSpacing = 300; - 5 min block

1 hour=12 blocks
48 hours=576 blocks
576\54~10.6 blocks per 48 hours  but usually 4-6 times


bumbacoin
July 22, 2017, 03:41:04 AM	

are you talking about your own staked blocks ??

there are two things you might not be considering,

staking is probability based and dependent on network variables - "expectedtime" is only a guide and also fluctuates based on changes in difficulty
and
your staking ability is limited by the amount of staking inputs and their relative maturities.

.
open your wallet, go to preferences, enable coin control

go to send window, select inputs .

this will enable you to see how many individual staking inputs you have (note, unconfirmed or immature coins will not be visible as they are not eligible for sending yet)

i have 35+ staking inputs, does it change anything?
"weight" is already calculated my actual weight of netweight
I understand that an approximate calculation of time is shown, but the difference in 2 times seems to me more than it should
What is the ratio of the blocks to the time you have?

GoodHabit
July 22, 2017, 09:07:10 PM	

The situation with staking is at least confusing. I tried to figure out what "coin maturity" means. In the explorer I discovered that most blocks were awarded to a small number of wallets - according to the Richlist most of them in the top 20 - that staked blocks sometimes every hour. But the "coin days destroyed" that serve as base to calculate the reward were in many cases relatively low.

(At least lower than the >50 Million I get under "your weight" - but I still wait since about 7 days (- since about two days the expected time fluctuates between 2-3 days))

Initially, I had been assuming that every stake rewards ALL accumulated points of the staker getting the reward, and the counter then is set to zero. While large wallets would move to the top rather soon again, the changes for smaller wallets to at least get rewards sometimes would be far bigger (or at least sooner). But - as i figured out - every block only rewards PART of the weight an account actually holds, and therefore only reduces the weight very gradually, so that large wallets will remain on top for quite a long time. This is discouraging for people who are new to POS rewards, and is likely to undermine goodwill.

When I was waiting for my first staking reward (ca. 10 days with a bit more than 8 Mio coins) I did some digging with the Explorer (than still updating). My impression: autosplit of staking inputs creates to many small input fractions in larger wallets, so slowing time to get reward for all, and making it particulary difficult for relatively small wallets to get started.. (small in that context: <25 mio)


GoodHabit
July 29, 2017, 06:13:06 AM	
The estimate will come down... When I first started, It gave me >37000 days, so just slightly more than 100 years .. With 100k coins.. but it did come down..

GoodHabit
July 29, 2017, 06:26:41 AM	
Unfortunately.. if my guess of auto-splitting slowing down staking is correct..

The solution would to have:
a) generate (much) more blocks - - or -
b) reward several inputs at once, and then auto-merge them in to larger inputs...

BUT - both would require another Hard-Fork...

It just needs a decent pump, a few more exchanges, a better website - and a dev Plan.

(I'd suggest: masternodes, android and IOS light wallets, a strategie to get some major retailers on board - in several important countries)

May be an (open -- End?) prolongation of the POS stage-probably with lower , but still significant reward..

Could still have more potential than >95% of all the other shit-coins.. But most likely wont...

Seems the network is recently accepting more stakes by really OLD inputs, even if they are relatively small (even below 100K). But the bulk still goes to a few top adresses, even if they now also need much more time, due to quite a lot of many relatively small inputs (broken down by earlier stakings).

At least i noticed that the possibility to AUTO-MERGE small inputs seems to exist, although I only saw it with inputs of less than 100 k and maturity well over 20days... (And not for me... - have no so old / small inputs - but I staked a few times when my staking wight was >70 Mio - now with >130 Mio - im still waiting...

(but this is probably because network wight has more than doubled in the meantime - so there is still a lag building up...)

GoodHabit
August 04, 2017, 02:52:59 PM	

well - it only goes up and down as a result of the method coinmarketcap calculates marketcap...

Every time a "Hero-Investor" - or Micro-pumper - spends a fraction of BTC buying at the price of the massive sell-wall of 1 satoshi - the "price" jumps up.

Whenever the very few buys at that price drop out of the statistic, the price collapses, because it then is calculated on the very low price on the LTC market only.
(Both LTC, DODGE and as well ETH and ESP markets have prices FAR below one Satoshi..)

So what a real rise would need... Pumpers/investors would have to buy the LTC/DOGE/ETH markets at Nova up until they reach satoshi level - would involve investing 2-3 BTC or about 5-10 k $

Then they could move to another exchange, sell the few ECA's the transferred to each other at high prices (get coinmarketscap to notice the higher price at other exchanges). With a much higher price on other exchanges visible, the sell-wall at nova might crumble, the low volume would be gone - and some other people might get attracted to a "fast rising coin..".

But such a move would afford a real investment - several BTC or several K $ (or Euro or whatever) that someone is really ready  to put at risk...

I'm afraid you misread..  that was most likely a suggestion and not an announcement..

GoodHabit
August 05, 2017, 10:44:53 AM	
Well, the System seems to have a bias to slow rewarding down... When a wallet has accumulated sufficient staking weight to get the next block, the preference seems to go to the input with the lowest reward, as long as this input can still be split in 2 outputs..(that is: has coin age below somwhere between >11 and <12 days).

Small rewards keep the weight of the staking wallet high, so allowing for higher staking frequenzy - and smaller inputs require more blocks..

But probably this has gone a bit to far..

IF - and only IF - the observed possibility to auto-merge inputs upon reward only considers maturity (and not only applies to very small inputs), this should iron out eventually... But probably somwhere around an average maturity of 25 days..

While the little action is disappointing, claims about a scam /or pump seem unjustified..

How can it be a (successful) scam if practically no one is buying - you cant buy cheap on Novas LTC, DOGE or ETH markets and dump high at 1 satoshi on the BTC market, because the queue for dumping is so long..(almost 1.9 Billion ECA - or just <10% of total supply...). OTOH - that there are still occasionally people buying (low quantities) at the BTC market either means: they do no math / just don't like to convert their BTC in something else first... - and are looking for something wich is not that clearly an OBVIOUS SCAM - like most highly rated coins on Nova actually are (I'm not talking of BTC,LTC,DOGE or ETHER here...-but much of the rest...). For a pump it looks to meager / diletantic - the buy wall is to high to overcome it on NOVA - or you would have to really invest (about 20 BTC) - so you would have to buy-out the minor markets (2 BTC would do there) and than move to another exchange (small quantities - allowing the HODL group to mainly buy and sell to each other...)...

So no - no scam, and not really a pump - just a little bit to little activity....

Everyone,

Considering that Stratis is also in CryptoBE, Electra getting the most views there is quite an achievement. I am aware there are concerns that I am posting less frequently. As Electra is working properly at the moment there is less need to do so. Also, note that I am only able to fully work on the project during weekends but despite this have achieved all of Electra's short-term goals. The immediate goal is still the same: get into an exchange where Electra can be bought and sold with fiat currency. I am in contact with a person who has successfully listed his own altcoin into Chinese exchanges who I believe can help speed up this process. Stay patient, I am fully determined to achieve this goal.

GoodHabit
August 16, 2017, 07:48:12 AM	
Wondering how much of that is just due to my searching for the rules of staking...  several 100 hits a day certainly...  
Well - let's summarize what I got from digging so much with the explorer...

There are by far not all adresses staking...

From the top 8 on the Richlist:

#1, #5 and #7 aren't staking at all (about 22 % of all ECA combined...)
#2 + #4 (combined >10%) are staking permanently - these accounts are already broken down in to many relatively small segments. This has the effect, that although they get many blocks, they are more and more falling back - they get significantly less reward than would be appropriate, because they would need more blocks - OR LARGER INPUTS -. But the BIAS of the system to SLOW DOWN still occasionally splits relatively small inputs (reward them EARLY - so that they have not to big maturity to split) while rewarding much larger inputs LATER - maturity is often >20 days...

#3 - an account with initially rater large blocks (solo mining during bonanza) was offline from July 14th to August 4. On coming online August 4, it started to catch up (large blocks with huge maturity - therefore many extra coins - and only later, those large blocks started to get split - so this account still gets a lot of reward with relatively few blocks, due to still large inputs...

#6, #8 and #16 - of which at least 2 - if not all 3 - are likely to be controlled by the dev - started out with inputs of XXL or XXXL size. While they stake regularly, the lag behind far less than #2 and #4 - because they have still - on average - much larger inputs - which reach lower maturity before staking - and than usually still split... (So those accounts suffer less from the slowing down due excess splitting - yet) So - if im correct about those (at least partly) - being the accounts of the dev - he would feel this less - at least at the moment...

Generally, the network weight is still climbing significantly, a clear sign that the lag is increasing, making it more an more difficult to get a fair reward.

(I haven't been a able to trace the staking FORMULA, although I tried to find it in the source code... - so im doing guessing from observation only...)

And to "Kiddo" - re-arranging the inputs BEFORE they stake probably (except with very small inputs) doesn't help much - it just resets the counter to zero...

Well - 1/730 should be correct (the reward formula is (CoinDays x 0.5 / 365))(Or just plain and simple (CoinDays / 730). Most adresses I checked got between 50 to 70 % of that - not because of a different formula, but because there are to many inputs waiting for reward, and so the network weight is still building up. (Splitting of inputs goes still on, although there are already far to many staking inputs) IMHO, an average staking time of 3 to 9 days per input would likely be optimal, so the network would need about 1200 - to 1600 staking inputs - there are certainly many more...

But if you get 1/600 per day, you must be a special case - so we would have to look at the relevant details - for that we would need to no what adress your refering to...

The fact that not everybody is staking should not increase reward over time - it should just mean that the maximum supply will be reached later....

But my question adressed the fact that I couldn't find an account for which your claim (1/600) is valid over an extended period of time (say since August 1.). All accounts received clearly LESS than 1/730 - so you would either have to be a special case OR your looking at a to narrow time window...(without knowing which ECA-Adress we are talking about, I can't check...)

You are funny bud, ESP staking is working but not for low amount holders! On-topic yes 25% is better then 0% but is not what the dev said in the specifications. Maybe I stake less coins and I get a low reward heard that someone around here is getting ~80%.

GoodHabit
August 21, 2017, 07:31:51 AM	
This is just an unverified claim.. without knowing his address, we can't really know - but the claim seems implausible... 

Actually, the reward is calculated correctly for 50 % (actually more if you include possible compound interest) - but the intervals are growing (the coin-age of the average block getting reward goes still up.. - and so goes the network weight) - which means that you get your reward LATER (and might miss out on compound interest) - and that smaller wallets will have to wait even longer.
So if some people would actually take their wallet offline for a few days, this might help   (reducing network weight - but once they go online again, they will still get reward according to their coin-age - that has been building up offline... / that, of course, is not actually what is the intend of POS...)

Dream on...   - the wall at one satoshi is still standing strong (>3 Billion ECA). Their has been an outlier at the DOGE market, but someone probably made a typo and over-payed - so that there was a short time when the DOGE/ECA price was actually over 1 satoshi... (but for very small quantities only...)

(just checked again - only half of the 3 Billion ECA is on sale for 1 satoshi - the other half hoping for higher prices - so the wall has come down just a little bit...)

GoodHabit
August 21, 2017, 07:34:32 PM	
definitely is... #15 on the Richlist (actually) was the original Premine address (**see note A)

It was reorganized on July 7, when #6 on the list was created as a spinoff (starting with just ONE huge block).

#8 actually has a very similar structure (huge blocks), was as well reorganized on July 7, but the source of the coins is more complicated... but this could easily be a address of the dev as well, if he participated in mining during the bonanza - solo or via pool.

If all of them are different addresses in the same wallet, this would explain why they perform quite a bit better than average (large weight in the network - far larger inputs than average, so staking frequently - but not VERY often, but getting large rewards..) (but actually starting to fall behind as well now, with inputs getting smaller due to frequent splitting).

**note A - this Address is still used by coinmarkets-cap to calculate the difference between "total supply" and "circulating supply" - they just wanted to exclude the pre-mine from the circulating supply - but as this address is staking as well, and the amount is (due to the aforementioned reorganization) much lower than the original premine, that doesn't really make any sense anymore...


Electra01
August 21, 2017, 10:22:18 PM	

I can confirm that I am participating in the staking process not everyday but often. Due to the low share of the pre-mine and frequent splitting, the impact should be low. Even when staked, the pre-mine share should remain within the 3%-5% range.

I took part in the bonanza with a medium range graphics card and generated about 3,000,000 ECA which is kept in a seperate wallet.

The value in Coinmarketcap causes Electra's value to appear only about %1-3 higher than reality. As the pre-mined ECA will eventually be transferred back to the address given to Coinmarketcap, I do not want to bother Gliss about it. He has 1100 other coins on his list to worry about.

Why are you staking the premined coins? Don't you think that's a bit unethical and misleading based on the quoted premined amount on the announcement page? Is it possible for you to list all of the addresses where the premined coins are held on the announcement page? The community shouldn't have to do investigative work to try and find where the premined coins are located. This coin has potential, but the hiding and moving around of the premined coins just seems shady, and has an unnecessary negative effect on the future and value of the coin.

August 23, 2017, 05:19:54 PM	

I am staking in order to cover the initial, and possibly, future investments I have/will put up for this project from my own capital. Examples include exchange applications, Coinmarketcap bounty, Block explorer, Cointelegraph, and outsourced node hosting for the first three months. The pre-mine was not sold or claimed at all for any of these investments. My personal costs add up to more than $1000 which is about 100,000,000 - 200,000,000 ECA with the current market valuation.  Rather than claim part of the pre-mine to myself and sell it in exchanges, I have preferred to get my initial investment back through staking as I believed it will cause less unrest among stakeholders and also because I want to play a part in moving the blockchain forward. If stakeholders prefer me to claim part of the pre-mine to cover my costs rather than stake, this is also possible.

I announced that the pre-mine would be moved into other adresses in a previous forum post. It was not hidden. All transaction and staking history can also be clearly viewed in the block explorer.

These are the addresses where the pre-mined coins are held:

Sorry, but isn't that a typo? 3'000'000 during the bonanza would be a bit few...

Sorry to get a bit annoying...

The first one is correct... The second one doesn't exist on the network...  The third one never held more than 2 ECA...

But its possible to trace the majority of the Premine to: EVggmyfsA7krt7XsCYyh5DVe5JxDbVs5cZ

#8 (EfC1H6fsvZSfHMdsbdLN2XYDx1o7d1GYpM) on the richlist is one of my personal addresses... Yes, I did try to put everything I have into that address on July 7th, 2017 but I failed to realize that I have more coins than the max amount it will let me send, so I tried sending the max coin amount over and over to get all my coins into one address... But I would hate to see someone accuse the Dev of bad things without the proper facts, that is the only reason I am owning up to my address.

Also if you want to list it on coinexchange.io the fee is 1 BTC, on cryptopia is 400k DOT (around 0.75 BTC) I wouldn't recommend yobit, maybe as last option.

Last I heard Cryptopia was 5BTC to list it on there, but it is a decent exchange.   I would say that it seems like a good choice if the developer is looking to get exposure for the coin.

The problem ultimately will be whether it will repeat what we see on Nova which is just people dumping everything they have into the market and saturating it.

We need to get above 1 sat in order to probably be taken seriously

Nop, maybe it was, but they changed the fee amount. Indeed it was like 5 BTC (2 millions DOT) but now is 400k which at the time of this post is like 0.744 BTC (400k DOT @ 186 sats).

If they didn't changed this in the meantime.

This person is also a domain broker and has also bought the domain electraproject.org and will be developing it in two languages: English and Dutch. He says the website will begin development by the end of September.

Meanwhile I will be visiting two exchanges in person during the next two weeks with the aim of reaching a better deal with them.

In my opinion right now focus should be on the development of the coin.
In the past 24h trading volume has been around $300. There is no point in adding exchanges if there is no interest in trading ECA.
Interest will only come if there is active development with actual progress.

POSW is releasing their new website next month, you should definitely consider adding ECA to it for auto-staking.



GoodHabit
September 23, 2017, 07:58:40 AM	
Just some observations - doesn't look really good...

Dev activity is very low... doesn't even care to have control of his own software..

(The actual wallet (2.Hardfork) was released by a different dev, who put it on his own github repositiory - the dev (Electra01) never cared to copy the wallet to the official Electra site on Github..) Once the the link to the "Bumbacoin" repository was deleted, there was no working link anymore. Some days later, a user who had saved a original copy created a new link on Github. A few days later, "Bumbacoin" shared a link to a saved copy of the wallets on his private "Google Drive". But instead of copying this files to the Electra Gitub - or any other web-address under his control - the Dev only updated the links on the announcement page. So the files are still not under his control... - but on web-addresses under someone elses control (even third party google-drive addresses...)

There ARE technical issues...

While staking is working more or less properly - and blocks are found regularly - this is only more or less. The calculation of the staking reward (50 % annual) is correct, if you include compound interest, it could even be more..

But - the splitting of inputs - and a somehow inbuilt bias of the staking algorithm to reward those inputs in a staking wallet that receive relatively small rewards - (certainly as well with the intention to create a sufficient supply of staking inputs) - has made the staking process difficult for smaller wallets - they are crowded out as the biggest wallets still have a very huge share of the network weight - because many of their inputs are waiting for reward for more than 20 days by now. So "smaller" wallets (small meaning here everyone with <100 Mio Electra) are only seldom staking. Most of the rewards earned by addresses holding relatively few electra - like just a few 100 k ore few millions - are almoust certainly secondary addresses in larger wallets. (Some of those adresses seem to belong to "Coinsmarkets"-Wallet).

There seems to be the possibility of auto-merger of small/very old inputs - but I have observed this only with very small inputs - and it might well be that all of them are on the Coinsmarkets-wallet - so maybe they run a slightly adjusted wallet?

Since the last hardfork, there are only about 210 blocks found every day (and not 288 as in the OP) - and so the time to reward all blocks is even longer.

Total coins created between july 14th and today (september 23th) are 711 Million - expected would be: (20 Billion * 71 Days /(365/0.5)) would be 1.945 Billion. So only about 36 %. This, of course, was mainly due to the fact that less than 50 % of all coins have ever been staking. If more would have been staking, the crowding out of smaller wallets would of course have been worse...

On the technical side, you could of course state that due to this slower staking, the PoS stage will take longer - like >3 years - and thus the Dev does have time to come up with a solution for the time once the 30 Billion coins have been generated... (As there are barely any transactions beside staking - and almost all of them are only stakers or exchanges reorganising their wallet, or people sending coins to or from exchange, there can't be an incentive for going the chain running once you would switch to fees only - unless their has been a rapid and very strong adoption of Electra as a means of payment - and even than only if you can get the Electra price up to about $1.-- (or at least $0.10).

Actually, the share of staking coins has gone significantly down in recent weeks**, probably as low as around 30 % - as many large stakers have fully or partly decamped (moved their coins to exchanges, and tried to dump them). OTOH, there have only been a few larger moves the other way.

As a result of these changes, the market price has significantly dropped, and the sell wall has gone up.

Not only are there 3.2 Billion Electra on offer at Nova against Bitcoin - of which 1.6 Billion for one Satoshi - recently a wall started to go up at the Litecoin market - actually there are more than 1.33 Billion Electra on offer there, and even on the DOGE Market - more than 550 Million on Sale. So about 25 % of all Electras are on offer on Nova-Exchange. Another ca. 480 Million are on sale on Coinsmarkets... And of course, most of the sales that actually happened didn't result in the buyers shifting large amounts to staking wallets... So they either still hold them passively on the Exchanges, or put them in new sales orders (doesn't really make sense as long as there is no positive price movement). And yes - about 28% of all coins are held at adresses that showed no movement at all since the last hardfork - did they miss the update - or just lost interest... (well - I suspect that the top Adress on the Richlist might be Nova-Exchanges Cold-Wallet... - but who knows...)

But - unless their is much more activity - likely including an active HODLING Group - and more support for/by the Dev or a dev team - it pretty much looks like a dying coin..     

**unfortunately, this didn't help smaller wallets, the network is still going up, as now most blocks go to large wallets with small blocks (some of those that decamped actually had very large blocks, thus needing not that many blocks for reward, and thus speeding up...

The latest links that were provided for the wallets are from my personal Google Drive account (not bumbacoin's). I can upload these to other download locations if people wish. I used bumbacoin's Github link in the forum before to give him credit for the new wallets he created. The deletion of the link by bumbacoin did catch me by surprise and I put up my own links as fast as I could.

Despite Electra having the issues you mention, I do not believe they are serious enough for another fork in the short-term. However this is my personal opinion. Electra is larger than myself and if the majority of the network wishes to have these updates implemented and release their own version of a wallet, I will support it after I am satisfied with testing.

To myself personally, the fact that Electra is listed on multiple exchanges, has a block explorer, working wallets and an active website/forum thread is just as important. If someone new joins the network, I try to ensure that they will always have access to live uncensored information about Electra.

Can we get an update on what is being worked on on the coin itself? It looks like for the past month or two, you have been trying to get ECA listed on more exchanges.
I personally think it's in the best interest of this project to get some more technical development going on instead.
The community needs to see real progress. Getting listed on some small exchange with low liquidity will not help this project moving forward.

"While staking is working more or less properly - and blocks are found regularly - this is only more or less. The calculation of the staking reward (50 % annual) is correct, if you include compound interest, it could even be more.."
After my calculations stacking sucks, not even 25% is now for my 150+ million ECA bag. I get something between 130k and 160k everyday, sometimes 2 days till I hit a block, but never above 160k. I think I must stake 1 billion +. ANyway is not about the reward here, the problem is the developement. Very long term this means 1-3 years (considering implementing masternodes) not implementing, just considering.




GoodHabit
September 27, 2017, 05:05:03 PM	
Well - with something >150 million ECA, you should get >200 k/day (on average). But reward is calculated on coinDays of each staking input - thus if a large part of your coins are still waiting for reward, it will take longer until you achieve a better quota. (But not necessarily a higher amount in the wallet). As there are to many small staking inputs on the network, average coin age to get reward is still going up... (it takes longer until you get a block, but as you - or your staking-input - will have accumulated more CoinDays, reward will be higher) - (But often the system selects inputs that receive relatively few coins, and lets those that are due more get even older, thus accumulating more future reward). (If many users would manually reduce their number of staking inputs by manually merging smaller blocks that recently staked in to larger inputs, it might speed up) But don't manually shift older staking inputs around, because this would destroy CoinDays without getting reward, und thus destroying expected reward...

UPDATE:

I am getting these types of questions as PMs also so I have updated the Getting Started page in the official website to avoid confusion. The guide now provides step-by-step instructions for POS rather than POW. View here: http://electraproject.weebly.com/getting-started.html


I have also recived a reply from Coinomi which one user requested and I have shared the contents with you below. Answering these questions seem to be the only requirement to get integrated. Therefore I will proceed with the application.


Hi,

Terrible apologies for the late response. The whole sector is experiencing tremendous growth and we're scaling up as fast as we can to meet demand.

To be able to estimate the effort needed for the integration we request the info below. I know some questions were already answered, but to keep things organized, I'm leaving all the questions from our questionnaire. Please reply after each question in a new line.

 - Are you a core team member?
 
- The official website of your project
 
- The official code repository
 
- Coin ticker symbol

- The Coinmarketcap entry

 
(Please answer with as much detail as possible)

 
Is your coin a derivative work of an existing project?
 
If yes:
 
What is the original codebase you have used?
 
Have you modified the block and transaction serialization formats?
 
Have you modified the block proof of work hash function?
 
Have you modified the block id hash function as is reported in the RPC?
 
Have you modified the transaction id hash function?
 
Have you modified the cryptographic signature algorithm in any way?

Have you modified the standard scripts for sending, receiving or in general?

Have modified the script language in any way (if applies)?

Kind Regards,

Hello All

 what is  Min age?

 So I was wondering what the block size should be? for good staking

Like 25k , 50k  or more ?

  any help thank you


GoodHabit
October 01, 2017, 03:33:16 PM	

24 hours
Much more

Minimum should not be below 2 Million per block. Smaller blocks will get reward eventually, but it can take a long time. If the Wallet-Size is  large, small blocks with get reward eventually - if the block size is not to uneven -  but to many small blocks already slowed the staking process down significantly. If you start with only one very large block, it would auto-split every time after getting reward in two blocks of equal size, thus creating more inputs, but only if you hit a block in less than 11 days. If you start with one large block, >100 Million would be good to get auto-splitting started. If you have significantly less, several blocks of about equal size should work out o.k. But as network weight is already quite high, wallets that hold less than 10 Mio will take quite a bit of time to hit the first block, and even smaller ones will need very much time.

When inputs of less than 100 K coins hit a block, they are usually part of an address with significantly more coins (several small inputs), and if addresses with less than 1 Mio hit a block, they are almost always part of a larger wallet...

There are actually between 7 - 9 Billion coins staking, and cummulated coin days (network weight) fluctuates between 85 - 118 Billion coin Days. (depending if some wallets are temporary offline). With an average of just 210 blocks a day, this means that the average block is already 12 days old and will usually stake later - after 20 days or more. If we divide 8 Billion by 200, this means that about 40 million coin days need to get reward per block - just to avoid that the network weight increases further and thus increases the average time for reward even more. 40 Million CDD / 20 = 2 Million coins. So, all blocks smaller 2 Million actually slow the staking process down.

This is true, staking is very hard for low bag holders. I'm staking near 100 million coins and i get like 600 -700k ECA every day or sometimes on 2 days, which is not the 50% stated in the coin specifications. Anyway I don't stake them anymore, because I can even pay for electricity to keep the wallet running.

October 15, 2017, 07:00:17 AM	
Difference between POW / and POS  -  with focus on Electra-Coin.

All cryptocurrencies need a sufficient number of full nodes, that are computers who have an up to date copy of the entire database and are mostly online, and can therefore communicate with other notes and participate in the validating of the blockchain trough consensus.

If they are truly decentralized, they need an incentive for people to provide hardware, energy and network connections, and therefore, each block found (that is  -  added to the blockchain) receives some newly generated coins as block reward. The node that adds a block is called Miner.

If the coins are somewhat valuable, there could be many people that try to mine them, and thus not only will the maximum coin supply be reached soon (if there IS a maximum coin supply)  -  but to many blocks in short sequence might create problems to reach consensus among the nodes.

Therefore, a threshold is needed to decide who can get (mine) the next block. Classical Coins like Bitcoin or Litecoin use Proof Of Work (POW) to decide who can next mine. Under POW, potential miners need to perform some additional mathematical operations to qualify. Thus the threshold is called difficulty.

If a miner qualifies and gets a block, there is at least one transaction  -  new coins are generated and are credited on the miners address. If there are additional transactions, there might as well be transaction fees. Those are added to the BlockReward. The new coins that are now new at the miners address are kept together as one INPUT  -  but kept separate from earlier or later inputs.

According to he UXTO-Model (Unspent Transaction Output Set)  -  each Address can have separate <<Piles>> of coins that are separated from each other (called Inputs). And if you send coins from this address, you can only send entire Inputs (Inputs are always either spent or unspent). If you send less than the total of one Input to an address, the change goes either back (as a new smaller input) to the original address (if this is set as default change address) or to a separate newly generated address within the same wallet.

Now, if a POW coins becomes very valuable, like Bitcoin, the difficulty has to be raised exponentially to keep Blocktime stable, thus raising the threshold very high. So, to mine a bitcoin block, you have to waste a lot of energy and hardware to qualify for a block, and thus Bitcoin-mining has become expensive and highly centralized.

So, to avoid this problem, Proof Of Stake, POS, is a different method to determine who can mine the next block, a different threshold. To qualify, Coin-holders need to keep a certain amount of coins unspent (not moved) for some time.

The wallet that runs a full node calculates staking weight by multiplying the inputs in all the addresses it controls with their respective age (CoinDays), broadcasts this to other nodes. The sum of all the broadcasts forms the network weight. Comparing network weight with staking weight of each wallet, the network determines which wallet will mine the next block. The wallet then selects one of its inputs, generates the new coins for he block reward (transaction 1) and in a second transaction resets the staking input (sets it to spent) and creates a new input (unspent) out of the former staking input + block reward + evtl transaction fees.

There are two main forms of POS Block reward  -  fixed reward or proportional reward. With fixed reward, as in POW, each block gets an equal amount of new coins. So  -  to optimize your wallet to get as many blocks as possible makes sense  -  more blocks = more reward.

With proportional reward, the amount of newly generated coins per block varies. It is calculated as a proportion of the << coin Days destroyed >> of the input that gets the reward, that is number of coins multiplied with coin age multiplied (or divided) by a fix factor. Thus, the inputs that don't get reward now are likely to get reward later, and if they get reward later, their reward will be bigger  -  more CoinDays.

Electra is  -  after a short POW stage  -  a full POS Coin with proportional reward. (Reward is CoinDays of the input getting the block divided by 730) (=50 % of 365 equals 50% annual).
So there is not really an incentive to have many small inputs and get as many blocks as possible, the rewards per block just get smaller, and if the network uses more blocks to reward all staking inputs, it takes longer for everyone to earn the expected reward.

If the proportional block reward is high enough  -  like with Electra  -  it would  -  for the staker  -  make sense to have as large inputs as possible  -  or just one  -  stake rarely  -  but get reward for the full amount. As this reward time would on average be earlier than with small blocks, the staker can get more compound interest.

Staking the same Addresses on multiple wallets might result in earlier getting a block  -  and thus in less reward per block. But certainly not in more reward (you can't get reward for the same input more than once). The Coins are not IN the wallet, they are on a given Address on the Blockchain, the wallet holds only the keys to the Address. So, if an address is controlled by multiple wallets, each wallet will notice that the input has been redeemed (spent).

Now some specifics for Electra:

Each input starts counting for stake (earning weight) 24 hours after its creation. Block reward is 1/730 of the CoinDays redeemed  -  that includes the first 24 hours. Each input that earns reward within  the first 11 days after its creation is split at output (including block reward) in 2 new inputs of equal size. There is a possibility to auto-merge inputs at reward, but this has been observed only for very small inputs. All inputs that get reward are rewarded for the full coin-age  -  irrespective of how long the wallet has been offline. There is no maximal coin age to get reward (AFAIK).

There seems to be an inbuild bias towards slowing down reward  -  frequently smaller inputs that get less reward, or relatively young inputs that can still be split, are rewarded earlier than those within the same wallet that would get more reward. This was probably designed that way to create a sufficient supply of staking nodes and keep the network weight high.

Some of the best performers among stakers seem to have only a small number of inputs and keep their wallet offline for some time (>11 days). This tendency seems to have increased recently, so that the network weight actually declined.(at least for some time) This tactic, of course, runs against the purpose of staking, because it reduces the number of nodes that are actually active.

This is a field where I really see a necessity of some technical improvement: Reduce maximum age for splitting (e.g. <3 days)  -  introduce auto merging of older inputs (e.g. >9 days)  -  and exclude inputs that are mostly offline from reward (e.g. all inputs with more than 30 days coin age  -  a transition period of a few thousand blocks would be required here). A further area of technical improvement is the block time  -  while the OP states that the target is 288 / day, we rarely get >210, although many inputs are expecting reward. It seems that there is a flaw in the difficulty adjustment formula, which increases fast  -  but decreases slow, and thus often leads to large distances between blocks  -  up to one hour. Here I'd suggest to keep the adjustment for every block, but not calculated from the last block, but from a rolling average (let's say 12 blocks / one hour back).

Can you prove this? I am staking 50 millions ECA for 4+ months, so I should get like 25/3 millions from stake. In ECA 8+ Millions and I have like 55 millions after 4+ months. So something is wrong. Maybe the big holders get 70-80% and it compensate  )



GoodHabit
October 15, 2017, 11:15:42 AM	
Well, staking reward only works properly since the second hard fork  (july 14th) - so 3 months. But older inputs can still get the full reward if they didn't stake yet.
But with calculation 3 months / 90 days x 50 Million = 4'500'000'0000 coin days / 730 = expected reward ca. 6'160'000.

To verify if your claim is correct, I would have to know your ECA-Address, to look it up with the explorer. No risk involved in publishing it here.

If you ask staking, at first it takes couple of days(4-5) to give start staking. Just patience and keep your wallet active.

Cheers

24 hours until the staking sign turns green /how long it takes until you get your first block depends on how many coins you stake and on how many other people are staking

the best scenario for a fixed PoS network is to have a high network difficulty created by many inputs.
so yes, the current code does encourage the wallet to split and slow down rewards, but as you say leaving your wallet offline for >11 days gets around this.

adjusting wallet combine/split/age thresholds is relatively easy and only requires compiling new clients.
it's unclear whether that would actually positively effect the network as it might end up reducing difficulty and make it more susceptible to attack.

reducing max stake age is a hard fork, as is changing difficulty adjustment
also a hard fork is changing to  a fixed reward to encourage constant staking with many inputs

i quite like fixed reward, this also has the effect of reducing effective inflation rate over time.
ie current inflation rate is 50% which equates to ~10783349272/year, (although the real effect of 50% pos is not actually 50%)
converting that to a constant reward of 100,000 coins/block gives roughly the same apparent inflation rate, for now, but as the coin supply increases the % value of that reward decreases

difficulty adjustment will never be perfect :/ there are many attempts at getting the perfect system,
but especially when the network is prone to large fluctuations in stake weight (wallets offline for much time) it will continue to vary widely.

another way to help with connnecting to the network is to use inbuilt IRC
you''ll need to add
Code:
irc=1
to your electracoin.conf

on start-up yr client will then connect to irc, and join a dedicated electracoin chatroom to look for other clients

Hi,

Could anyone please let me know where i can find a wallet that will run on Ubuntu 16.04.
I have no idea how to compile, but if anyone has the github links and can walk me through it, i will happily try compiling.

Thanks

For those who can't get there wallet to sync, don't forget to create the electra.conf file in the appdata folder for electra and add the nodelist given in the OP.
I wondered why it was not syncing and noticed there was no conf file present in that folder.
So I created it and added all nodes to it. Now syncing is lighting fast and almost ready to add my coins to the wallet.

Aditionally if this dosen't work either, you can create a Shortcut of the Electra-qt.exe, go to Shortcut's Properties and on the Target field add "-conf=electra.conf" (without quotes). Run the shortcut.

STATEMENT

Electra does not have any involvement with the following ICO: https://elektracoin.com/?affiliates=fe8c15fed5f808006ce95eddb7366e35

As i promised, a small manual to build Electra wallet under ubuntu

I used a fresh virtual machine with Ubuntu 16.04.3, let me know if you have issues in later versions, we'll try to figure something out

So, first i added the bitcoin repository to install libdb4.8, because
Quote
Ubuntu 12.04 and later have packages for libdb5.1-dev and libdb5.1++-dev, but using these will break binary wallet compatibility, and is not recommended.

So, the instructions are:

Code:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo apt-get install git build-essential libssl-dev libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev libboost-all-dev libminiupnpc-dev qt5-default qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools qttools5-dev-tools

mkdir ~/src
cd ~/src
git clone https://github.com/electra01/Electra
cd ~/src/Electra

qmake
make

I assumed that users would like to build a GUI wallet, so i included qt-* libs.

After the make command finished, you will have the Electra-qt executable file, which is th Electra coin wallet. You can copy/move this file to any location.

Code:
./Electra-qt

At the first run you will most likely see an error message. Just start the wallet again.

And don't forget to create the Electra.conf file in ~/.Electra directory and add some nodes. Somehow, it is not created automatically.

I am in the process of applying to new exchanges due to the temporary closure of Novaexchange that will take place in four months.

True. This is what we are trying at the moment. But everything must be aligned together. Right now, the new web design is ongoing with a better look.

I bet the instructions are the same for any OS. If you download and run a pre-compiled wallet, of course. The only difference is the location of electra's blockchain and electra.conf.
In linux, they're located in your home directory, like /home/user/.electra
I'm not too familiar wit Mac, but electra should have similar location there.

December 15, 2017, 10:58:50 AM	

Hi All,

New Win wallet is almost completed. Now GUI design left. We will customize our win wallet with customized button and interface that our members feel special among many other wallets. Sync problem is over. Recent blockcahin included ( yes size increased to 50MB but depending on your connection speed you become ready in 1-2 minutes ) . Once the total package is finished, we will run a Totalvirus scan as well.

Meanwhile, our volume started increasing on coinsmarkets. Even at Doge markets, we are in top :5 ( sometimes No : 1 ) But unfortunately as CMC has no doge market links in calculation, this doesnt reflect to our real volume. You can check yourself all those by navigating.

Maybe you have checked our twitter announcement . We made our first agreement with the first "online merchant " which is accepting ECA as optional payment. We will increase amount of mercants in time. We  beleive that ECA has a real future and this will be proven by choise of several online businesses and users.

Soon, you will see some good volume increase and new big investors by ECA. Details we cant share here much but stay tuned.

Cheers

5,000,000 ECA has been sent from the pre-mine fund to the support the raffle we are having.

December 17, 2017, 09:31:11 PM	
Thank you very much for your contribution. We will collect some more here among other members ( already received another 1M ECA )  . Later on, funds from purchased tickets will be added to account as well. The prizes will be calculated on % basis, so, as much as we collect , the prizes will increase.  ( 1st , 2nd ... )

We will start promoting and announcing the raffle in 1-2 days through all social channels. We hope this will bring some fun among the community

I was having no connections with the wallet, so I grabbed the addnodes from Novaexchange:
Now it's sync'd up in less than five minutes. Great network =)


These should be added to the OP

I really like the 1 (or less) ECA fees for transfers. I see vision in the roadmap that could be compelling for long term investors too. Also, can't wait to see this listed on more exchanges~


Electra01
December 18, 2017, 02:38:09 PM	
It is in the OP. It is listed under Nodes. I put the link instead of each individual node because the are a lot of nodes and the link is in real-time.

ANNOUNCEMENT


A new exchange is opening soon called Next Exchange. They are currently allowing people to vote for coins they want added. There is no fee or sign-up required to vote and not much competition. Just go to the link provided below and click UPVOTE. About 300-400 votes seems to guarantee entry which is easily achievable with the size of the Electra community. Each person gets one vote daily.

https://nextexchange.featureupvote.com/suggestions/2840/electra-eca


Remember that every exchange Electra is listed on will add value to your holdings. If you own ECA, it is in your interest to vote daily.

When ECA was first listed on Exchanges, there were only 45 coins available [circulating supply]. So if someone bought a small fraction - like 0.005 for 1$ - this resulted in unrealistic price per coin - like 200$ in this example. Once coin supply increased VERY FAST - as planned - price per coin crashed hard. But now it seems to recover...

This coin is going nowhere as long as the dev is not ready to pay for good exchanges for Electra to be listed. According to him. he said this early this week "I have spoken with coinexchange.io. Most top 50 exchanges ask for 3-5 BTC for a listing. Prices are insanely high at the moment."

He thinks it's too expensive at the moment but the fact is, the listing cost is going higher due to a high number of coins flooding into the market.

 22 billion Electra coins mined/circulating with no good exchange.  I will check back when he's ready to pay for listing but for now, there are so many better coins especially after the mini-crash that occurred yesterday.  Good luck people,

	


Gabman
December 23, 2017, 12:51:51 PM

well 0:00 GMT passed and i didnt get any extra ECA on my coinsmarkets balance.

do i need to hold it for longer or what, also if i solo stake in my wallet does it need to be online 24/7?

I noticed the nist5 algo doesn't get listed on whattomine.

Not sure if there is a process for getting algos listed, but would help maintain interest during any bonus period if it popped up on whattomine during that time.

Hi, i am wondering about the transaction/confirmation time from wallet to wallet. Currently it takes <2 seconds for transactions to appear, but it takes 25+ minutes for the confirmations to go through, i am wondering if this will get faster as more people use electra or is it hard coded into the coin?

They can probably list ECA on Cobinhood. It looks like a promising platform and nice UI. Still a lot of kinks though and not many other trades going on yet since it just opened.  I'm sure listing there would be cheap.

You're a bit late... At the moment there is only one option to mine ECA - PoS.
If you used to mine ECA on super bonanza period try to find wallet.dat file

Dear All,

Here are some updates ;

- We fixed the conf file auto synch issue for MAC wallet. We will release it in 1-2 days.
- We have a minor bug fix on win wallet. This will be also released
- Our new website , we work on it and hope to complete by end of this month.
- We have some ongoing discussion with big exchanges as well. But first "NEXT.EXCHANGE " will list ECA . For this we are preparing some files. We hope to get listed during early January.
- Soon we will start updating the github repository as well

Even today, team worked hard to provide some updates. We try to handle several channels at the same. Please dont blame us why this or that is not there. We still prepare . You cant imagine but we sometimes reply to questions like " What is wallet address ? " So, please contribute us to explain about Electra projects and be patience more until we sort everything better. We could leave the existing website design and only put more content but we think that Electra community deserves best always.


Cheers and Merry Christmas to all Electra Family

Rimtu
December 26, 2017, 01:34:23 PM	

I guess it depends on amount of coins you stake...

I mine every 8h in averege with 11mil coins

finnovatie.nl
December 26, 2017, 02:32:41 PM	

but how long did it take to get the first reward? And what happens if you withdraw some ECA?


cryptoneet
December 26, 2017, 03:06:04 PM	

you have to wait 12-24 hours for coins to mature (depends how many you have)


GoodHabit
December 26, 2017, 04:04:18 PM	

Coin maturity (staking symbol turning green) is reached exactly 24 hours after first deposit. When you get first reward (aka - mine your first block) depends on how many coins you have, and how many other coins are staked by someone else (thus the function of "your weight" vs "network weight".

If you withdraw some ECA, it depends. You can only spend whole inputs (stacks) of coins - but if you send them in several lots, you should manually select the input that is closest to the amount you want to send - then only this position is reset, and the change starts from zero - all the other positions remain unaffected.

kgroth13
December 26, 2017, 04:49:47 PM	
Is this from the ECA wallet or from CoinsMarkets?

Thanks!


GoodHabit
December 26, 2017, 05:40:48 PM	

The above is if you are staking with your own ECA-QT-Wallet (your system)

If your leaving your coins at Coinsmarkets, it doesn't matter what you do. Coinsmarkets collects all the staking rewards that have gone to addresses in the Coinsmarkets Wallet (that of the Exchange, not the local accounts of their individual customers), and distributes them every 24 hours proportionally among all the customers having balances at the time of the distribution (normally after 8.12 pm UTC). Your share is proportional to the number of coins you hold at that moment, and not of the average during this period.

Due to the high transaction volume on coinsmarkets in the last few days, the time the coins actually rest at a given address has likely much declined, and thus the share of coins staked at coinsmarkets might be comparatively low (compared to HODLers). Thus, the actual reward distributions are relatively low, compared to earlier times with very little trade and transfer activity...

Noob question again. I want to add my ECA to the ECA wallet, but I'm about to get a new computer in a few days. Should I wait until then? Is it easy to move? Or should I just wait until the new wallet to move from CoinsMarkets?

Thanks!
Kyle.

Hi and yes it is easy to move just be sure you lock your wallet and back wallet.dat file keep it some where safe.

Elctra is a great coin! I love the community and the ultra fast transactions.

ECA Electra will be ready for mass adoption. Im sure that this coin is the future of crypto!

Beside of that its using the TOR network for anonymity...

So stay relaxed... The new website and wallet will be soon online! =)

Always seem to miss these coins with accelerated proof of work periods! However, the project looks good.

Looks promising, big volume, active community together with development and low price makes this coin a perfect investment. Don't wait too long because the price will only rise.

Electra01December 30, 2017, 06:29:42 PM
Announcement

I have been at direct contact with the owner of Next Exchange. Our team have followed up on all of Next Exchange's requirements and Electra is on track to be listed. We have done our part. The staff Next Exchange is swamped and from what I understand all the 17 "Planned" cryptocurrencies may not get listed on the same day. None of the cryptocurrencies have been given an exact date of listing but I predict all of them will be integrated within January 1-30 in order of highest votes. So we will probably be 9th in line out of 17.

Is there any calculator for mining profitability?
I wish to try mining it but there is no pool right now, is possible to solo mining.
What if in the gold rush pools go down because too much miners?

Thank you and good luck

Has anyone use a paper wallet? I had no idea that the coin can be staked. I tried to use the Mac wallet to import or sweep the ECA coins, but there doesn't seems to be a way to do it. I would appreciate your insights. Thanks!

MadMac
December 31, 2017, 12:56:10 PM
Put them in your coinsmarkets.com portfolio and they will stake for you. Easiest way to do it.

I understand, however, I put them all into my paper wallet and trying to find a way to get them out.


MadMac
December 31, 2017, 01:13:23 PM
Install the wallet, import the private key from your paperwallet, let it rescan and then you can either keep it there staking or transfer to coinsmarkets.


digerati
December 31, 2017, 01:16:14 PM
Thanks, but I tried that with the Mac version. I even tried to use the receive function. Maybe the Mac wallet doesn't have the import function yet.

Go to the console and write "importprivkey <your key>", that will do the trick.


digerati
December 31, 2017, 02:56:26 PM
I just discovered the console by going to debug and imported the private key with the command line you provided.

However, the wallet was not in sync. I read that there was a new wallet. Installed the new wallet, but it crashed while opening. So, I tried re-installing the old wallet with the same crashing results.

I also tried to install Homebrew and Wine to run the Windows version, but it could not find electracoin.exe in System 32 directory.

I'm pretty much not going anywhere so far.



electra1dollar
December 31, 2017, 03:11:57 PM
Electra is a very cheap coin you can easily buy around 100000 to 1milion coins and sooner or later this coin will go up to between 0.05-0.2 dollar and you just made around 500000 Dollar $$$. This coin is a 100000% Coin for sure and if it goes down you only lost around 600 Dollar.
The upside potential off this coin is just to much to not invest.            

####$$$$$$$$

over 100% just today so far i expect this to go up to $0.009000 USD in the next week
and by the end of Januar it will be around $0.04 USD




digerati
December 31, 2017, 03:20:34 PM
I was able to remove the hidden Electra files in the System Library folder and the application did not crash. The wallet is still out of sync. I read that it needs Tor to connect. I remember that when I have the Android wallet for another crypto.

How High will the shitcoin go before it goes down
im in 600 dollar does not matter if i loose them i can afford it, if you invest in 15 shitcoin and 1 or 2 goes 10000%
it dos not matter if 8 goes to 0 and 5 stays the same.

The price for electra was once 866 dollar in jun 2017 for a short period, it has a long way to go, but the new website looks good https://electraproject.org
and it will be added to two new exchanges in january 2018. Looks very promising.

Yes they will be listed on 2 new exchanges they say on their website

"Electra can be bought on coinsmarket.com. We have 2 more exchanges where we'll be listed on during January 2018. Stay tuned!"

they don't say which on yet.

Sweep or import from ECA Paper Wallet

Download the Mac desktop wallet. Let the wallet sync by leaving the application open for as long as 30 minutes to clear thee out-of-sync message. Then, go to Help --> Debug Window. Then, click on the console button on the top. Type in importprivkey privatekeyhere "paper" with the quotes. Close the desktop wallet. Then, go to terminal app or command prompt and type /Applications/Electra-Qt.app/Contents/MacOS/Electra-Qt -rescan

Then, that will re-open the Mac desktop wallet and your contents of the paper wallet are there. The instructions, hopefully be similar, it just that the file path would be slightly different, depend on the Windows OS.

Subu from Discord's ECA help as well as Studly and @MadMac here assisting me in this difficult task.

Hey guys, Happy new year to all of you, hope u all have a year with great profits but most important, peace, love and faith. This is my first post on this forum, i always read it but never registered 'til now... ive been mining for over a year now, trading for some months... a while ago i started trading with electra (remember my first trade when it was around 2 satoshis), i liked it since the begginning, dunno why, no website, twitter had activity two, liked this proyect.. anyway, i downloaded the wallet, bought some eca's and send them to it... but for some reason its not staking, it says that i dont have mature coins; may someone tell me whats the meaning of this?
Time??? need to grow up      ? xd...

anyway, thank you very much.

PSD: would have been a nice touch a Happy new year salute on twitter, it might be silly but i know people cares about this tiny things.

regards!

what does it mean?



electra1dollar
January 01, 2018, 05:46:36 PM
For staking Electra, coins need to rest for a minimum of 24 hours in your wallet. So, if all your coins are just new in the wallet, if you have recently rearranged all the coins in your wallet, there are no coins "mature", so you are not actually staking. In this case please wait 24 hours and the coins will be mature and ready for staking.

How many ECA do you need to stake annually? Can someone tell me this?


I also received the "not mature" message but that changed practically within 24-48 hrs as I'm staking now.

Still how does the staking reward system work? How often is the reward and how much do you need to see annual staking rewards of 50%?

Clearly not enough lol.

But the staking days are ticking down to 13634 and then 13621 days etc so it appears to move down over time. This is pretty interesting.

I've seen a few threads stating that the Nist5 algorithm is more energy efficient than other algorithms, such as equihash, with this being used as part of the reason of using this particular algo.

Is there any detail or evidence that this is the case or how this shows itself in general mining? My GPU's are running at similar temps using the Nist5 algo, plus I'm power limiting anyway due to high electricity prices in my area.

How many coins for MN? and for staking, someone said he have 22k days to find a block, is there any way to stake every 30 days, how much ECA do i need?
Also total supply 22,946,575,454 ECA and max supply 30,000,000,000 ECA, with 50% POS reward it will fill in 1 year, where do you plan getting staking and MN rewards?

Yep, also make sure to unlock your wallet for staking as well. Just check the little box "for staking only" on the password screen when you click unlock. How many coins you stake and how often depends on your coins/weight vs other people's coins/weight. Supposed to be 50% annual interest though.

any speculation for value for this year? I think I'll grow a lot with the Roadmap information and the incredible transfer speed.

It would be great to list in another Exchange, in Coinmarkets the site is horrible and I can not even log it in so slow.

Hello,  I have around 300K of ECA in my wallet.  V1.2.0.0

My staking weight is around 2M but it is hanging around 200 days for stake.  I know there is a lot questions about this but I dont really understand why it is taking so long to earn stake? Its been open about 6 days. 

Any answers would be appreciated. 

Brew


JohnDoe3490
January 03, 2018, 04:11:45 AM
Longer wallet open, the staking gets shorter. So your 200 days will be shorter once you keep your wallet open for a very long time.

It mean when you will continue stacking time to obtain reward should be smaller and smaller(depend net difficulite, sometimes can raise) and some day you will stack ECA.

When will be 1day to... chance is big

But not just as with coinsmarkets, is there any news for entry into other exchanges? There is Next.exchange news, but there is not even a more functional platform.

I'm sorry I don't quite understand. I'm under the impression that it currently just takes a few minutes for the 'expected reward time' to get from 30k days to 0 days, is this correct? And if so how do I claim my reward/how long does it take until I receive that reward?

coinsmarkets was forced to switch to fast servers because they cannot keep up with the demand of electra coins which reached 3 Million USD in volume. once electra will be listed on a decent exchange such as coinmarkets, cryptopia or kucoin. prices will explode. btw, we're listed on 2 exchanges already, next.exchange is surely in the pipeline. hoping for more updates as soon as possible.

From the About section on the coin homepage:

"Through PoS, you can earn and increase your investments by 50% annually until the total circulating supply reaches the maximum supply."

So what incentive do people have to keep coins after the maximum supply is reached, and how will new blocks continue to be added to the blockchain? Or will the coin just die once the maximum supply is reached?

Your website is missing some very basic features, like a whitepaper and a dev.... These are big no-nos and a warning sign to all considering purchasing this coin.
Choose Life
January 06, 2018, 09:43:41 AM
The staking wallets will earn from the TX fees after POS, I'm sure I read that on the website somewhere Mr FUD.

no, they didnt, in fact, i kinda like CMs somehow hehehe, tons of "shitty coins", but seemd to me like a serious place to trade, i was doing it myself for some weeks, got good profits on it; just couldnt handle elctra's rising... electras volume was like 4x above the second coin, they didnt expect it.. and if we take a look, TOTAL cryptocurrency volume has reached the 800 Billion usd, and most exchanges are getting laggy, like, biftinex everytime iota reaches a L/H limit, bittrex having issues with wallets, kukoin lately, cryptopia have had its downtimes these last couple days, binance also... im talking about bigones.. poloniex has hold the massive increase of investors very well, i dont like poloniex actually but i have to give them the credit about having good servers; another big exchange house that you can recommend or im missing?

PSD, i remember my first investment with electra, 3.5M coins wih 0.016 btc T.T!!!! sold it when i doubled it and well.... why didnt i keep the half when i doubled it right?? had to spend lot more for a 1million coins but cant complaint, im staking and i wont made the same mistake again
Now that i remember i bought 0.03 btcs on embers at 200 satoshis, now its 5x higger on cryptopia, good to know that i couldnt sell it xDD.

denyboyJanuary 06, 2018, 01:41:18 PM

ECA its going to reach 1 $ in the next 6 months and it can go to 5 $ before 2019 . Why? because this year crypyocurrencies are going to explode . When market cap get to 1 trillion  its going to be on every channel news in the world and its going to atract the attention on real big whales . You have to understand that most of billionares and trillionares are old people who dont understand tehnology . Meny dont even know how to use smartphone or use facebook . So not only that they dont understand chryptoworld but a small market doesnt get their attention also . But 1 trillion market cap get attention to everybody . This year its going to be boom . So dont get enthusiastic when ECA get to 1$ , be ready , sell something but keep the coins for 2019 . You are not going to be sorry . People sell their coins now for a few kkk . They are going to regret in about one year when they are going to remember that they had ECA coins  , sell it for almost nothing , and they could be millionares . Remember 1 trillion market cap its a door to opportunities ...

Good Question.

At the very moment multiple coins they deal in start taking off, they do a server upgrade. Marvellous!
BUT I do like CoinsMarkets. All users make sure to check out their 'Stake' page.

On the virus question... I expect they are false positives. I get them often on all sorts of software.
Electra wallet hasn't triggered anything on my system and I run a lot of anti-malware and anti-virus stuff.
But hey... I don't know for certain.

You don't have 2 wait for your wallet to sync before sending coins to it. I am 100% correct here. Once you download your wallet, you are set. The addresses you create from that wallet are 100% yours. Make sure to back up your wallet and save your encrypted/password...you will be abo=le to find this in your %appdata% folder. Safe the .dat file on an external device, preferable 3 separate devices and stored in different locations>>> not a bank vault.

That is only because coinmarketcap.com get it's statistics from coinsmarkets.com, and coinsmarkets.com is down because it couldn't handle the 9mil$ daily volume.

ECA is being traded normally on coinhouse.eu with daily volume of 500k $, which is not that bad... The current price is 60 satoshi, and this shows that there is still good demand for the coin.

So if you consider this price with all the thing you have mentioned... no whitepaper, what happens when max supply is reached,... if the project continues to be developed, the price could be significantly higher

If the coin were scam, it would be dead months ago.

And devs promised whitepaper in Q1/2018... so we shouldn't wair for too long to see...

EDIT:And just as I finished wriging my post, I see that ECA is listed on yobit... good work!

This looked like a market crash and I bet loads of people sold off panicked.
They could have put a message up or something!

I mean if you looked at the previous transactions, most of here bought off of coinsmarkets.com. But ultimately, it is up to you to trust them. I trusted them and I bought a significant amount of coins off of coinsmarkets.

im posting this as a buyer beware.

eca wallet ....filled with virsues
only place you can buy eca you will get robbed

the eca dev sent me to

https://coinscontrol.com/

to buy and sell ECA, I sent coins over, and they dont show up. chat room is filled with people talking like, surprise surprise coinsmarket with everyone asking where their deposit is.

then they say SHOW SHORRY and your stuck with no funds.

there are only 2 other coins being trades on https://coinscontrol.com/ and thats a coinscontrol coin and eca. the other coins are the btc, ltc, ect

so isnt it funny, that one exchange closes down (coinsmarkets) and another shady one opens up (coinscontrol)??

isnt it funny how the DEV of ECA are telling everyone to go buy at coinscontrol

isnt it funny coinscontrol is only selling 2 coins, theirs and eca...

I think the ECA dev set up both exchanges to manipulative price and dump coins on new comers

I have ECA and I want to sell it all. I want nothing to do with its infected wallet and shady exchanges

dont buy ECA you will be stuck with nowhere to sell it.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED....BUYER BEWARE

Wow. Some not so bright people in this thread.

The ECA wallet, like nearly every other qt wallet, can trigger false flags for trojan virus. There is no virus in the wallet. Even if there were a virus, it would have nothing to do with CoinsMarkets.com going down.

However, ECA did crash CoinsMarkets.com because at the time it was the most popular coin on the site by a large margin and the only site where it was available. It drove huge amounts of traffic to the site and the site has now been trying to create new infrastructure to meet demand. It also drew attention to itself and CM was victim of DDOS attacks. Things CM probably should have been prepared for but it was a low tier exchange in a budding market, this sort of thing is to be expected. If you haven't noticed, all exchanges are having this problem now due to the flood of new blood into the cryptosphere, if you haven't noticed most exchanges have had to stop new user registrations for this reason.

ECA, and to a lesser extent Colx, drove a huge amount of traffic to coinsmarkets and put them on the map. They know this and are actively trying to capitalize on it. They haven't run off with anyone's coins, if they did they wouldn't even bother keeping up the charade. They have too much to lose establishing themselves as a legit exchange.

Finally, I'd like some of what the conspiracy theorist above who thinks ECA and coinsmarkets are in it together is smoking please. That was about as far away from a logical explanation as one can get.

I want to clarify to the community the status of our current exchanges:

Status of exchanges eligible for Coinmarketcap

Next Exchange: Confirmed they will add Electra but not yet open.
Cryptopia: Their native coin required to list new coins called Dot has been bought by our community members and Electra will be added as soon as possible. Currently Cryptopia is having issues with their own platform which is causing some delay.
Yobit: They have added an Electra market but it has not opened to trading yet. No clear news on when it will open.
Coinsmarkets: Website down due to server updates. Removed from Coinmarketcap.


Status of exchanges currently not eligible for Coinmarketcap

Coinhouse: Has an active Electra market but not eligible for Coinmarketcap due to 0% fees.
Bitafex and Coinscontrol: Has an active Electra market but not eligible for Coinmarketcap.
Novaexchange: Electra market active but due to ongoing takeover deposits/withdrawals are disabled.


There are a few other applications we are also waiting on. When Yobit, Cryptopia, N.E. or Coinsmarkets activate their Electra markets, they will be added to Coinmarketcap.

I smell a scam going on.  ECA isn't listed on Coinmarketinfo.com anymore.  The major site that had 99% of its trading is down, been down for days, and didn't give a damn about giving users any advance notice like novaexchange did when they wanted to so call "upgrade" their servers.  It only takes literally one day to fully get a server up and running and Coinsmarket.com has been down for 2 weeks.  I'll bet anyone 10 BTC that by next week, the truth will come out and Coinsmarket will be the first exhange of 2018 to scam us. 

Good job Coinsmarket.scam.  F you right back!

I've been on many website talking about Coinscam and nobody has EVER posted a screenshot of the site working or showing any personal wallets.  If one lucky person does show it, he or she is probably on the scam as well.  Only the scammers will have the "happy go lucky - the site is the best in the world and gonna come back, just watch" attitude.  The people who have lost control ever their coins without advance notice like Novaexchange have a slightly different experience.

I bought ECA on coinhouse.eu the other day and wanted to transfer to the wallet I downloaded from electraproject.org but the wallet will not get any active connections so I can't transfer the coins to it.  What's going on?  I want to get them off the exchange asap, should I send them to a paper wallet?

They now state on their website:
We are here to stay , there is few DB issue we are fixing due to DB overload . Now we may be moving due to users contacting hosting and calling us a fraud.

Keep checking their website but I already said goodbye to my 150$~ coins of ECA.

I got my wallet working and transferred my ECA to it.  I wanted to set the wallet up to stake and read the staking guide that is linked on page 1.  My 2 questions are, can I change the conf file after my coins are in the wallet or did I need to do that before sending my coins to the wallet?  And 2nd, can I make user and password anything I want them to be?  Thanks for the help!

Dallas1971

That is EXACTLy what you are looking at is web-caches.  For now on, if a coin isn't on one of the real exchanges that makes DEV responsible, I'm not investining in that COIN.  The exchanges the DEV's complain about are the exchanges that make them act responsibly and they don't like that.  If you look at the top 30 coins on Coinmarketcap.com, non of their DEVs complain about exchanges.  Now ask yourself..Why is that!?!?!!

It will be interesting to see how this plays out.  I mean this week has been a really weird one for alts.  Lot of red.  Maybe it will be blessing that ECA was down in the shadows during this time?   Who really knows.

I hope CoinSmarketS (there are two S's people) gets back up and running.  1. Because I have other coins just sitting they (they better be staking), and 2.  That would be a huge loss to several coin communities if those users lost out on those coins.

Well, if they wouldn't come online again, you d'still have to identify the addresses where coins are on Coinsmarkets, and if you wanted to burn them, you'd need a hardfork to disable those coins from ever being spent again...  If they couldn't be burned successfully, there is no  other way to prevent that they would eventually been cashed out.

OTOH - It seems that many of their wallets seem online again, and that CM is actually - or was a few hours ago - participating in ECA-staking.

UPDATE REGARDING EXCHANGES AND COINMARKETCAP

Electra has been added to Crypto-bridge which is a modern decentralized exchange and one I personally believe has good potential to grow.

Electra has been re-added to Coinmarketcap using the markets from coinhouse.eu and crypto-bridge.org. The current circulating supply on Coinmarketcap is wrong. It should be about 22 billion not 800 million. Therefore Electra's true valuation is still around $180,000,000 (not $5,000,000). I am speaking with Coinmarketcap to get this fixed as soon as possible.

Electra won't be over any more than Bitcoin was after MtGox should CoinsMarkets not come back. Sorry for your potential loss, but don't try to place blame on the Electra team for your misfortune and mistakes. Electra had announced upcoming exchanges, new wallets, new website and roadmap before CM went down. Electra didn't lead you to trust CoinsMarkets. You left your coins on there, and if you researched investing in crypto at all you knew that you don't actually have your coins until they're in your own personal wallets.

When I found ECA and had researched all I could, I saw massive potential gains (and have made them even with today's corrections) with the huge staking rewards as a bonus. I bought as much as I could as quickly as I could, each time transferring to my new desktop wallet. Right after my last purchase CM went down so I have some on there still too. I'm still hopeful it will come back online, but in the meantime my personal ECA wallet has already staked rewards and is working flawlessly. Keep your heads up and at the bare minimum, learn the lesson of keeping your own wallets. And Hodl.

Mt.Gox happened before there were a 1000 other coins to choose from . .  

Electra has already shot its wad.
With the new exchanges up, it can't even get past .005 cents.
With CM it reached .01 cent.
The momentum is gone.
All you can do is hope for CM to come back.
The ECA community has been reduced to a bunch of whinig idiots.
Electra Devs better get off their fucking ass and get in touch with CM dev and apologize for the death threats from its community -
Slugs like 'Ultor' and 'SirStagg' at ECA Discord allowed that shit to happen.

I guess you don't like to do any kind of research. We made it to $0.0065 cents right before the entire market started to do down. A simply search on CMC can prove that. Yes, we reached $0.01 but for a few brief seconds, right before CM went down. The devs and team members have done everything they can to get in touch with CM, we even offered help but got no response from them. We have absolutely no contact with CM now. Also, you mention this as if the devs do nothing all day, each dev is working on something at the moment and are very busy, there's a reason why they aren't on discord just chatting. There's no need to start blaming people, ECA community is still very strong. If you chose to leave, fine by me. You're calling the community "whining idiots" when you're the only one complaining.

You seem to be such an expert, why aren't you trading other coins and because a billionaire then?


Isle of Groestl

Who says I'm hating on ECA? - that's your extrapolation. I am saying ECA won't do jack-shit without CM.

I'm not asking your sorry-ass for approval if I want to leave or not. 
ECA was not doing jack-shit before BTC and other coins started tanking - it started its decline once CM went down, and continued after other pathetic exchanges listed ECA.
Why? Tons of ECA are held hostage on CM.   

How the fuck do you know what I'm invested in?
You have to force your assumptions (really just vacuous exptrapolations), because you don't have the balls to ask.

Hi there,

Sorry if this question has been asked before, but how long before we see rewards from staking? I've had 20K ECA in my wallet for 12 days now and no rewards. If it is a product of so many coins being locked up in CM, that's fine, I'll just wait.

JustOneAndDone
January 17, 2018, 09:16:09 PM
If you look at CM, ECA held a healtht value but as soon as we saw this entire market dip, ECA also dipped (along with every other coin). Currently I believe that 2-4.5% of the circulating supply is on CM. This is the MOST that could be on CM, maybe it's less. They did allow withdraws during the first week, all we can do is wait.

Force assumptions? What are you even talking about? No one is "stroking" me on discord. You like to call people out for "wanting power" you once told me that I get off on power and called me a "faggot". Have you seen you Facebook group? It's a close group where no one can post anything until you give them approval and if they don't agree with you, you kick them without hesitation. How's that for wanting power. Then you judge us for controlling our discord channel and attack a lot of my mods. I think you have a serious issue and you should check up on it. I'm not here for "power" or to silence people, I'm simply to stop people from spreading false information.


GoodHabit
January 17, 2018, 09:56:53 PM
Sorry, but with the actual network weight, and almost 20 Billion coins likely staking, 20K is far to little to expect reward in any reasonable time - you might have a look at the guess that is shown when you pull your mouse over the green arrow - while the time decreases fast in the first few days, (and can go up sometimes, if more people take their wallets online) - it will probably take longer than indicated  with a relative small amount, when you have been staking for more than 10 days... / there is a possibilty, that, without changing the rules, 20 k on their own will never hit a block before max supply is reached


iammist
January 18, 2018, 12:26:15 AM

foxy
anuary 18, 2018, 06:03:51 AM
I think you will have to hold atleast 1M tokens if you want to get stakes daily. Otherwise start with 300K but it will take some time for you get stakes.




MadMac


January 18, 2018, 09:17:45 AM
All ECA stuck in CoinsMarkets. And a bunch of kiddies crying for "authorities" to step in. What should these "authorities" do, other than potentially confiscate all business assets including all coins. We've seen it with MtGox. Nobody has seen any coins back in years. Hope they can get their servers up running again. But hosting is probably not the right solution for this, they need real servers in a real datacenter.


selectnumber123

The new site is very gorgeous, but the website opens and the sub-sequences open more slowly, which is a big team doing one thing

GoodHabit
January 18, 2018, 11:32:03 AM
my guess is that to stake at all, your wallet needs a weight of ca. 80 Million coin days, to come close, as long as the network weight is >100 Billion. With 20 k coins, this would likely take ca. 4000 days, or roughly 11 years...    One million in one block should stake every 2 - 3 months... If the Million is split in to smaller amounts, you might stake more frequent (as the weight doesn't drop much after each stake) - but those will be small rewards only, and on average be slower, so you would loose out on compound interest.
You could probably have near to daily stakes with one million only if you cut it in many small inputs of around 30-40 k each. But the initial wait would probably near 3 months, and the daily rewards would be very small... For 300 k my guess would be 6 - 8 months until you reach first reward.

Almost daily staking, that doesn't slow reward down for everyone, would require at least 20 inputs of at least 2 Million each, so a total wallet size of >40 Mio

GoodHabit
January 18, 2018, 03:49:28 PM
Yes - I know - if everyone cuts his wallet in to several inputs, everyone will stake slower. I just answered this in a way correct for those who are more interested in staking frequently, and not so much in getting maximum reward. And if your total wallet size is to small, faster might still mean - never before max supply is reached...

Many Reasons.
1: CoinsMarkets not quite back online yet. (See electra.news and facebook updates about CM coming back online soon.
2: Micro exchanges that ECA is currently on don't provide for much volume.
3: ECA massive staking reward means many people who invested are holding fast, with no intention to sell.
-----Add the fact that larger exchanges are scheduled to start trading ECA soon, the great development and communication from the devs, the community around ECA, and the current price compared to other projects make for a fantastic hold investment.

Scam.  "Electra01" and team have already shown that their other founder, Aykut Baybas, was a scammer in Eagle Coin.  Now he's part of the ECA scam.  Ashame, because I had very high hopes for this coin.  The ECA team knows this, and they've refused to kick him off the project, which tells us about their intentions.  Unfortunate.

Hi everybody,
I found something very interesting,
Can you guys share what you think about      

1) Looks like a coinsmarkets.com and electraproject.org it's one owner or one team.For me it's very wierd.
Why ?!because they are group of scamers, who try to play with your money, manipulate , even steal it.

2) now I understand why other big markets(yobit,nextexchange and others) doesn't want take this coin ,because they feeling sometging not clear and wrong.

3) what make me think it's a scamer market and scam coin,
--->>>> they been registered the same day almost the same time  !!!coinsmarkets.com and electraproject.org <<<<---?  ??

Here we go -->> https://electraproject.org.cutestat.com
Then here -->> https://coinsmarkets.com.cutestat.com

4) that's why they hiding, they afraid to be clear, they trying to be smart ass.

5) possible that coinhouse and crypto-bridge own by them too.

6) Mostly I understand what they doing now, basicly collecting all your bitcions(money) and playing on the market.And they waiting that day btc will jump to the moon.
That's way they trying to find so many reasons to extend the time.After may be they will come back or they will disappear.

7) Another things , most of the team from web site, it's a bul**t team, as believers. They don't know each other on the real, they know each other as project, just from chat. They manipulating them.And I feel sorry for them.



There is a lot of to say, but please share what you think about.

You making a very good point.

Secondly, their first website is been updated. But I doubt if they own crypto bridge or coinhouse

You got it "could be a planned work", that I tought, they trying to play like a smart ass and they know what they are doing, I was saying crypto bridge & coinhouse "possible" they own or  it's in one team(scammers team).
Also possibility they own not just ECA may be some other shit coins too.
Another things, in telegram chat most of users are "bot".  if you pay attention there most of the time chatting the same people or everybody quiet, it's wierd.
 One more things , in telegram chat room they deleting "negative" smart questions or blocking users who posting smart questions, no explanation at all, they don't have answers for smart questions.

January 23, 2018, 08:47:35 PM
Changing the order of your points a bit for clarity..
Well, this one is obvious bullshit: date LOOKS similar, but coinsmarkets.com was registered on march, 9th, 2017, and electraproject.org was registered on september 3th, 2017 - so each time a nine and a tree - in month and date, but just half a year apart... Coinsmarkets was up and running long before the actual Electra-Team started to get formed, and the web-domain registered. (And yes, I look at the above links, that's where I get the DIFFERENT DATES from...
[/quote
Ha,Ha,Ha..

next.exchange is not even up and running, so to call it a big exchange seems a bit premature, but Electra is still on the list of the coins that will be listed from the start --> see next.exchange website...

And then there is Yobit - Yobit is up and running, and you can find (an non working) Electra/BTC market since about 2 weeks, with buy orders... Problem is - if you want to deposit, Yobit says since two weeks: "deposits for such currency are temporary offline". (So there can't be sell orders, because no one can send Electra to Yobit.).

Now, this is a typical Yobit problem, you can find dozens of coins where devs and community are complaining because Yobit doesn't answer their tickets, doesn't include mandatory wallet-updates, remains on the wrong chain after a hardfork for years, and yes, you can also find many "coins" that don't even exist anymore, because the chain died years ago, no devs, no community, but still trade (but- of course - no deposit and withdrawal) on Yobit. They rarely ever care if a wallet of a non major coin is online or syncing properly. So - may be - once they installed the Electra-Wallet, it took more than 10 minutes to download the entire Blockchain, so Yobit just gave up - and kept the monney. (May be they will look in a few weeks if they now have an active wallet - but hey, that would be the usual level of support you get from Yobit...). Yobit doesn't care about quality... So to claim that the fact that ECA are still not actively traded on Yobit because of quality is just ridiculous...

I, personally, would never have suggested to apply to Yobit...
Unlikely with coinhouse, they just showed up a few days before coinsmarkets went belly up, and benefited from it, but they didn't list a large number of coins that got "orphaned" by Coinsmarkets (or Nova-Exchange, for that matter), and quite a few coins with very low volume, that you could get at Bittrex et all. (and therefore not generating a big demand on a minor new exchange.

Definitely not with Crypto-Bridge - (Crypto-Bridge is a decentralized Exchange with a own Blockchain, trading coins as tokens on their chain..) Unfortunately, I must admit, as much as  I like Electra, creating a decentralized exchange seems way over the head of the existing dev-team, especially months ago...

news on novaexchange:

Honoured customers and crypto currency enthusiasts! You have been told a while ago now that we were planning to close down Nova Exchange in the beginning of 2018. We made this tough decision because Nova Exchange was growing at a speed, and in a way, that us, the founders, could not keep up with and run the business in a meaningful and secure way. Not wanting to make promises we might not be able to keep, we didn't tell anyone, not anyone, that we never stopped looking for a way to keep going and keep Nova Exchange in business. So! We are so happy to announce that we have found a partner, a new main shareholder, willing and more importantly, able to carry on running Nova Exchange. The new owners, we have made sure, have the resources and the experience (6+ years in the business) it takes to provide excellent service to you all. We started negotiations and talks early in November last year, and now we can tell you the good news: The show will go on! More information will follow. In the meantime, just go keep on trading crypto. Best Wishes to you all!

GoodHabit
January 24, 2018, 09:43:10 PM
Is that all you have to say...?

But - no - not really. I have been following Electra since early June, there have evidently been a lot of initial problems, and I have asked some technical questions on that thread since early July. (You can find all of it here if you just read this ANN-Thread from the beginning...). There was very little activity during late July and August, and most of September, so it looked as might this coins as well die - there were always some people staking, but not much else, and the original dev didn't comment all that much - so doubt that he is still active arose. Then, in late September, a Telegramm group was started (not my prefered form of communication), some people started to get involved, but still, it didn't seem to really get anywhere.

There was always the exchange issue (trading on Nova far below one satoshi, but always some very few trades at just on sat (huge sell-wall) - distorting the price (leading to extreme fluctuations in the statistics of Coinmarketcap...) Very little trade on coinsmarkets.com - only against DOGE, clearly the secondary exchange. Then, when Nova was shutting more and more down, the issue became more pressing, but the only change was that coinsmarkets actually added BTC/ECA traiding, with price differentiation as low as 0.1 sat. This was a more realistic price, and thus, on CM fluctuations weren't that wilde as before. But still, early in December, I was convinced that Electra wont get anywhere.

The fast rise in price, starting from December 18th and getting more and more traction, came as a huge surprise to me. But most of the volume and price rise was just generated from December 30th to January 2. And from January 3, problems with Coinsmarkets started, although price still kept exploding.

While I personally jumped back on the bandwagon on December 18th, and saw my portfolio explode in value within just a few days, I still have quite a few coins stuck on CM. (No net loss, as the price explosion has multiplied my holdings, and I pulled much more out than I had invested, but still...)

So I hope - but don't really believe - that they might come back.

But claims that the newly formed ECA team has anything to do with the failure of CM seem really far fetched. If ECA want's to get far, there are still huge challenges ahead, and I have not seen a clear indication that the new team is up to it, but for that we might at least wait out the whitepaper...


futureBaller
January 25, 2018, 03:12:27 AM
ECA total suppy is in the billions, they can fork the lost coins stuck with CM and replace our coins. Then, to keep the price stablized, they can burn coins they used to replace our lost coins, it would mean that the total supply is greatly decrease and less for the developers. This is all my opinion of course. Also, I want to tell all the fucktards who are on their high horse why the hell we didn't download to a wallet, FUCK YOU GUYS WHO WOULD POSE SUCH A QUESTION. THERE'S A HOST OF REASON, LIKE MAYBE WE WANTED TO JUST HOLD FOR A DAY AND FLIP IT, OR SOME OF THOSE WHO GOT COINS ARE AT A DIFFERENT LEANING CURVE AND THE MORE EXPERIENCE BUYERS. THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH PAIN. AND FUCK ECA FOR PICKING CM AS THEIR FIRST CHOICE TO HOST THIS COIN.

If you're browsing and following this thread, looking to feed your Uncertainty (the U in FUD), there's always half empty glass posters to fill that. Just know that there are a vast majority of others who are quietly holding fast, staking in their personal wallets and believing in their investment and potential of Electra - not even thinking of selling. (research block explorer).  Electra had previously announced new exchanges coming online, have and are very active in social media venues, clear road map, growing team, (research ECA website) and upcoming white paper. CM not returning would in no way kill the ECA future. Believe what you want, just letting you know the positive side of the FUD that's rampant lately due to CM. If / When CM comes back online and you want to dump your coins you had left there, go ahead, just remember that someone else is buying them.

All the Coinsmarkets.com dumba$$es all have to say is "we will open the withdraw function only while we get our site back up and running"  then people will stop sending truthful emails to registrars.  Do the right thing dumbA$$es and people will let you be a dumbA$$ without holding their coins.  Dont you get it, you holding peoples coins and we will ruin you to the ground until we get our coins.  End of story.

How do you get your coins back if you keep closing their website which you can withdraw from though? If they are trying to get back online, why don't you let them and see if they enable withdrawal?

Electra's whitepaper has been released: https://electraproject.org/electra-white-paper_1.0.pdf

Wallet links at the OP have been updated. The community-made wallets offer an alternative UI to our v.120 wallets which feature a standard UI.

We are expanding the development team and a new Github team has been setup here:
https://github.com/Electra-project

Today, I will be sending the team 5,000,000 ECA from the pre-mine to fund development. Another 5,000,000 ECA will also be sent at a later date.

Does anyone has issues with BTC withdrawal from coinhouse.eu?
In short, i tried to withdraw all of my BTC using their 'Withdraw all' button. As a result, i have a record in my withdraw history with amount similar to 0.1234567890123456, i.e. 16 decimals, and status 'Suspect'.
I cannot cancel this operation or use these coins to trade. These shitheads do not answer freshdesk ticket or direct email. 6 days passed so far, and i don't know if i will receive my coins.
Although my previous withdraws went just fine, i wanted to warn people to avoid using this 'exchange' (at least do not use their 'Withdraw all' option and type the amount manually if this is the case)


bit.starts
February 03, 2018, 04:38:54 PM
Mostly every coin will be send instant. You will get a personal transaction. But Bitcoin is different. Since 2 January 2018 Coinhouse has added batched bitcoin transactions. These transactions need to be filled with multiple withdrawals. Depending on the amount of withdrawal requests, that will calculate how often transactions will be done. Currently this is a few times a day. But this will ge more often after more withdrawal requests.

Why did conhouse introduce this feature?
Batched transactions will cut transaction confirmation time and also fees will be cut. Also this is more efficient for the bitcoin network because we do more withdraws/payments in just one transaction. This will cut the amount of bytes and also the amount of fees which are needed to get accepted into a new block on the network.


starl1ngFebruary 03, 2018, 05:01:13 PM
Oh, come on, it's a bullshit. A copypaste from their website. Bitcoin transaction fees were significantly reduced recently, and they cannot compile a 'batch' for 6 days? They could at least reply to my ticket or email.
And yeah, their withdrawal fee could cover a dozen of near-instant transactions.

800 million ECA were on CM, many of which were Electra Devs - so they say.

If Electra Devs think they can just white-wash this issue, forget it. I've not even started. Electra Devs won't be able to wash their hands of this issue. Don't try to bullshit us with talk of "Community" while the original investors in the "Community" get fucked-over.

Electra Reddit Whore 'pbp8ntballer' had to lock this topic, he got uncomfortable after I posted this comment -
You're the typical egotistical selfish-bastard that will be exposed for not living by the Golden Rule. It is the fault of Electra for not doing their Due Diligence on this exchange. They won't be able to white-wash it no matter how many hound-dogs they have working for them. Imagine the great karma that would ensue if they announced they would reimburse - Not Likely knowing the corrupt mortals of this generation. In Heaven they would reimburse, not in Hell.

2) Left his coins on an exchange while shilling hard for it
3) Cries when his coins are locked/stolen by someone else
4) Expects to be reimbursed by Devs when he can't access it

Let me know Ty if you want Trump to bring your job back too. LOL. Do you ask Food Lion to give you reimburse you for your food if it was stolen by a thug?

I bet you do!

How about when your car gets stolen? Do you expect Chevy to replace it?

It's an exchange issue, not a dev issue.

When you keep coins on a ghetto exchange, you take the risk of having them stolen. The devs didn't force you to keep your coins on CM.

LOL

I got liquidated on my margin call too, the exchange owes me! 

We know the risks associated with leaving coins on an exchange. I'm guilty of leaving coins on exchanges too. We have grown a bit too comfortable  . . . and something like this (and this huge market correction) have shocked some people back into reality.

Everything is not fine. The community of ECA is cheating to get on the exchanges... I hold more the 2M coins, which i bought between 20-30 sat, so I actually invested a fair share.

Made this post again on Reddit (Yes, devs deleted my first post):
ECA community is scamming/cheating to get on exchanges... Made a whole post about this but devs deleted it.
Things that are happening in short: ECA's discord got a tip-bot. People are abusing the system and casting 1000s of votes to get listed on exchanges, they got whole guides setup in discord... Devs/Moderators/what ever you call them, seem to dont care...
They are spamming in discord to vote, they setup a guide on how to vote endlessly... Thats how ECA got listed on the last few exchanges and thats how they are on top on every voting system... People get showered with coins if votes increases alot.
Dont get me wrong, i hold more then 2M coins, which i bought between 20 and 30 sat. But this is going to kill ECA if this keeps up, if exchanges get wind of this its over...
Again, dont get me wrong i bought my share, but this aint beneficial for the coin...

I was very positve about this project, but this is making me lose my trust.

Electra is in crypto infant stage. Missed out? --- Not when DOGE is 41st in Market Cap, and Verge is 30th, and crypto as a whole is just starting to get rolling.
As far as the new exchanges and voting-  I've never been on ECA discord, I saw a facebook post regarding voting, went to the various sites and voted.
As far as complaining about voting for too many exchanges, go to Coinmarketcap and look at the other more established coins: OMG is on 31 different exchanges with volumes from 0$ to over 9 million per exchange.
I wish certain people would just get some wider perspective and think longer term regarding their investments. (i.e. don't flip out when after 1 month you don't have a lambo)

You cant get real proof, so it remains guesswork based on hints.. But if we count the adresses in the top 50 that were mostly created during the pump [late december up to Jan. 2], got most of their coins from earlier large addresses [whales trying to profit from the price Explosion by selling high slowly] have no outpayment after jan 5th, didnt stake between jan 5 and Jan 13th, and stake very regularly ever since, we get close to 5 Billion. And yes, my thesis is that cm wallet is mostly online and staking since Jan 14th

Has anyone calculated an ETA on Electra reaching max supply of 30,000,000,000?

Obviously an annual staking return of 50% per year is extremely attractive but won't mean anything if we suddenly find out that the max supply will be reached within weeks.


GoodHabit
February 12, 2018, 06:22:50 PM
Well, if staking continues at present rate (depending on how many coins are actually staked), max supply should probably be reached around August. It's - IMO - a bit disturbing that the Whitepaper / Roadmap doesn't say anything about how to replace it as incentive to keep nodes online... (And if the staking rules would be changed before max supply is reached - let's say to a declining ratio or a fixed reward per block - time would already be very pressing, if max supply should not be expanded...)


GoodHabit
February 12, 2018, 06:27:14 PM
I'm not kidding, but I think as well that 5 dollars are very unlikely, and thus I was suggesting that the steepest rise in ECA is already behind us [and thus, if you bought for 10 sat or more, you likely bought shortly before - or after - the long time peak...]

It is necessary to understand that if the currency does not support atomic swaps, then it can not be quickly exchanged for currency with atomic swaps. That is, there will be a quick exchange between each other only by using nuclear swaps, which in turn will require the introduction of a lightning net. And this means that the competition will increase and the electret will no longer stand out. Here, the role of currency marketing has to play its role. The team will succeed - the capitalization of electors will grow

ECA's true base doesn't care about the current price. We're enjoying our investment returns with our wallet stakes and have no plan for selling.

Oh, and I guess by your standards, ECA is 22 now, so that counts as mooning?

Well, atomic swaps are basically the re-invention of barther.. Just between Blockchains... The Problem with barther is, that you usually dont know anyone that wants to swap/exchange with you at a fair rate. Thus markets, and monney [as means of exchange and unit of account] had to be invented in the first place.. So this is a step backwards to the early [digital] stone age. The examples with merchants are all totally wrong, the merchant doesnt want to swap currencies, he wants to receive coins in exchange for goods or services. And thus, you will need a third party that is ready to swap the coins you have with the coins the merchant acceptst. And the most efficient third party service [Liquidity] will always be the largest centralized exchange.. [not the safest or cheapest \ the most efficient...

GoodHabit
February 14, 2018, 05:32:24 PM
Well, the staking process of Electra clearly favors large and very large wallets. At the present high network weight, you might need more than 100 Mio ECA to get at least one block a day, if your wallet is broken in to several medium sized blocks, 50 Mio might be sufficient. I'm actually staking only about 7 Mio, and get a block ca. every 10 days...(although my wallet always says 2-3 days, but it can easily stay that way for a week...). With only 2 millions, you would be a candidate for every 10000th block, or, with ca. 212 blocks a day, every 50th day... 500 k are likely to take even much longer, 4 to 8 months seem a realistic estimate, but, of course, that way you risk to never get a block before max supply is actually reached...

[And yes, unlike the stated goal on the website (and still in the whitepaper) - Electra has only had about 212 (and not 288) blocks a day since the last hardfork on july 14th, 2017. - and therefore, with less blocks generated, fewer wallets get reward, and the auto-splitting of inputs that get reward within the first 11 days further increases the network weight, and this makes it more difficult for smaller wallets to get reward frequently] [And yes - I first addressed this issue in this forum in late July, and a few times in the following months, but the devs don't see this as a problem that deserves correction..]

Not really - there was one huge pump in late december til january 5th - but the dump couldn't follow because most of those wanting to dump at high price have their coins stuck on coinsmarkets
Well, what the chart shows is: there hasn't been a real dump recently - volume is far to low, it's slowly declining because demand is low, but dump would be something else..
It's still worth something (depends of course when you bought - for all those who bought far below 1 sat (like 0.1 sat - or even below for Doge/LTC), the actual price is still attractive. So those can afford to wait if there will be another pump...

There is a rumor circulating online, that the developers of ECA are the same people that operated CoinsMarkets site.  I cannot know for sure, but at any rate I'm not thrilled about this ECA coin. Ain't got a single ECA.  I don't think I will bother.  Bought my 500K when price was accessible. Lost every last ECA.

Read it and weep - $0.001688

1. Massive Eca pump the days before CM closed. 90% vol  (Increasing 10000% over 1 week)
2. CoinsHouse and CoinsControl open the same day when CM close. (Same owner as CM)
3. Eca Discord warns user not to withdrawal on CH and CC (aka you can't withdrawal, only buy)
4. No one can withdrawal more than 0.1btc from CH or CC (They will send to the wrong address etc)
5. Eca added to CryptoBridge fatbtc. No volume. (Basically no one buys Eca)
6. CM has over 20billion Eca. Basically 90% of Eca. If it were to open Eca would be worthless.

Conclusion: Classic pump and dump exchange/coin.
Lesson: Never buy a coin that is only traded from one source.

February 18, 2018, 06:16:41 PM

You are extremely exaggerating...

1.correct - massive pump - almost no volume at all at the start of december, price below 0.1 sat - (or below $ 0.000004) so the actual price increase is more like 2000 times - or 200'000 % within about more than 2 weeks. But the increase also happend to other coins on CM, and the volume of CM increased from a few 100 k $ day to more than 10 mio / day. So, that they would crash seems plausible (CM was always a very marginal exchange before december, and looked pretty unprofessional) So, that they couldn't handle such an increase seems plausible. But there reaction isn't - agree that it more or less looks clearly as an exit scam now, although they are still staking most of the coins..

2.Coinhouse opened a few days earlier, but was absolutely unknown, ofc. We don't know anything about the owners of CM, CH, or Coinscontrol. To claim that they are the same seems a bit far fetched, at least they dont use a similar web-interface, and have two factor autentification. And besides ECA, they only listed very few (if at all) coins that were also strong on CM.

3.Don't know what your talking about, withdrawal both from Coinhouse and Coinscontrols usually works. It seems that there is an issue with Fatbtc, as they require a relative high minimum withdrawal and rather high withdrawal fees. (My withdrawals from Coinhouse and Coinscontrol all went to the correct address..)

4. Wrong - I did withdraw ca. 2.5 BTC from Coinhouse, in 5 transactions over 6 days. The only problem was, that the later transactions were first declared "suspect" and needed a support ticket to get cleared. Don't know if they improved it in the meantime, was in early january. Withdrawal from CC - no problems, although no large amounts.

5. The volume on Crypto-Bridge and Fatbtc is rather modest, although much higher than on all exchanges combined before the mid of december. So, not that many people want to buy (thus the price is declining), but there is also no real dump. For a decent pump, you would actually need a larger exchange, that would attract potential buyers.

6. According to my analysis, CM has ca 5 Bio ECA, and is regularly staking. (Where you get the 20 Billion figure from, IDK - this is definitely wrong - I could easily point to accounts holding >10 Bio ECA that are definitely NOT at CM.) And of course, the ECA telegramm or discord group would give you much lower numbers, but the fact that the admins there spread "confidence" in CM returning as dogma should turn people away...

Classic pump and dump coin? Hm, are there many others - probably 99 % of the people that recently joined the crypto market just did so because they hope to get rich quick. They don't do any research, and thus most coins rise due to pumps only (easier on ONE large exchange, e.g Bittrex) and not due to change in fundamentals. And some crash after pumps. But most people are just blinded by "whitepapers" that promise a big future, but will mostly never deliver, or not meet any demand in the global market.Or jump in at high price because of FOMO. So, pumping is the only way to make monney in crypto... (or day-traiding). Everyone is mostly looking for bagholders. I don't really claim that Electra is better - but this is something you could say about at least a thousand other coins (and especially most ETH-Tokens..)

Name calling and yelling aside,

Was the ECA mod team aware that the ECA was moved from deposit addresses back in January? If so, why did they keep telling people on Twitter that CM was coming back soon and everything appeared fine?

When coinsmarkets crashed about two months ago, at the same night electraproject.org also crashed and not reached about a day. Anyone thinks there is a realtion between ECA and Coinsmarktes.

Also peaople banned from ECA's telegram, discord and reddit pages beacuse of their opinions. Do you think this coin is decentralized?

Well, the wallet is online, and it shows 24038150667.7   ECA, but under the total of "Monney supply" / that is the total monney supply as shown on the explorer, and not the coins on coinsmarkets.
Well, I would like to know where you see the 800 mil on the Explorer - Which addresses do you see as CM adresses. (And of course your right that the 20 + bil is the total supply)

I did a longer analysis with the explorer, and did identify many addresses that I think are most likely on CM. The (not complete) list follow:

The total of ECA on those addresses amounts to almost 5 Billion. (I did a systematic check for all the top 50 addresses on the Richlist, and also added some smaller addresses that were created as change addresses trough payouts, and otherwise meet the pattern.

What all of those addresses have in common is that they were created late in december or the first 3 days of january, have received most coins from older big addresses (and usually the bulk from one address only), often had some outpayments before january 3th.
None of those accounts have any transactions between after January 5th and before January 13/14. But all of those accounts are staking very regularly ever since, and none have other transactions (beside stakes) after january 5th.

For the smaller accounts this might not be significant in itself, but accounts with more than 50 Mio coins usually stake daily if they are online. So while some of those addresses might actually not be on CM, I did no systematically check for ranks 51 - 100 of the Richlist,
and there will be many smaller accounts (mostly change addresses), that are on CM as well.

The fact that all this addresses are regularly staking, and that the CM website (on its old - or non https:// - addresses) shows wallets regularly online, doesn't say anything on itself about the likelyhood of CM coming back ever.
The official web address (https://coinsmarkets.com) is not reachable via cloudflare since days.

So - may be - the fact that we can only see the old servers that show no change at all (besides the amounts of coins on the online wallets beeing updated - and the occasional change in the header-text) could also be an indication that the old host just keeps the servers running,
but that nobody of the CM team is ever accessing them. (They might have disolved, the boss might have run without most of the coins, the owner might already be in jail or sufferd a stroke or heart attack and is now in hospital or dead..) - We just no nothing, but the only signs of "activity" - like additional lines in the header from "bear with us" to "few hours" to "last db issues" might as well be the work of a simple hacker..

We know nothing for certain, but if anyone from the team had access and wanted to save his business, he would have tried to communicate better - so, while we don't know what really happend, we can be pretty sure that no competent person is in charge.


While there is no clear indication of cooperation between the ECA-Team and Coinsmarkets, the attitude of the ECA-Team towards critics is at least disturbing. They are usually claiming that they are certain that CM will come back, and strike down so called "FUDers". If they could be certain, they would need to have a connection - what they deny.

But insisting on totally unfounded spreading of confidence / delusions is not helping at all. Creating confidence without base in facts is actually the usual modus operandi of scammers, - and it should be considered a serious crime.

Well, if you can use the explorer properly, you can analyze movements on addresses (with timestamp) and thus identify patterns that would give a very high probability (there might be some false positives - but not that many on the larger addresses - and the owners of such addresses could just prove me wrong by shifting some coins now... - But if you are to dumb to learn how to use the explorer, you can cry whatever you want... (And the statement "doesn't belong" sounds "knowledgeable" - so I might as well here your reasoning?
Wrong again - ECA seemed pretty dead most of the time between June to mid december. And, until mid december, coinsmarket was a very marginal exchange. So, with the pump of ECA - not starting before dec. 18th, and culminating between dec. 30th and jan. 3th, became relatively important for just a few days. Then it crashed. While ECA is now down to 1/4 of it's peak price, its still 500 times higher than it was (on average) before the pump, that means for most of its existence. So, while not all is well, it's pretty much more alive than ever before the mid of december.

Websites crash all the time, some come online after a short time, or at least have frequent updates (like Electraproject.org), others don't, like Coinsmarkets.com (at least - til now - and IMO - most likely ever).




JohnDoe3490
February 20, 2018, 11:37:32 PM
Just wanted to reiterate one fact that an admin of another coin did indeed visit CoinsMarkets.com address since a bunch of their coins were stolen too:

First off:
We completely understand the community's frustrations regarding CoinsMarkets, but do not wish to start a manhunt on the owners to harass or threaten them. This is not the type of impression Lemanum wishes to convey. Recently, I Tiny_Dave/TinyGuy personally traded under 7 Euros worth of Lemanum to check if everything was working as it should be. It was not. The CoinsMarkets situation has adversely effected  the Lemanum community, due to witholding over 20 million Lemanum coins. This is unacceptable.

The address information:
Bitcointalk user "stoffel" created an impressive write-up, which contained all of the contact details they were able to find regarding the location of CoinsMarkets. This can be found here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2185903.msg27944798#msg27944798. The address details obtained are as follows: "Surinamestraat 26, Den Haag", which is in The Netherlands. As "stoffel" stated, there is a foundation as well as a business registered to this address. This can be confirmed by visiting the website of the KVK (Dutch Chamber of Commerce): https://www.kvk.nl/zoeken/handelsregister/#!uitgebreid-zoeken&handelsnaam=&kvknummer=&straat=surinamestraat&postcode=&huisnummer=26&plaats=Den Haag&hoofdvestiging=true&rechtspersoon=true&nevenvestiging=true&zoekvervallen=0&zoekuitgeschreven=1&start=0&initial=0&searchfield=uitgebreidzoeken.

A visit from another user:
Another Bitcointalk user under the name "Fred290" visited the above mentioned address. According to Fred, an elderly man opened the door and insisted he was not affiliated with CM https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2185903.msg27582400#msg27582400. Naturally, this raised further questions.

My first visit:
On 16th January 2018 around 21:00h, I arrived at the Surinamestraat. Lamborghinis, Aston Martins, BMWs as well as a number of other equally flashy and expensive cars were parked on this street. The majority of the houses must have been worth in excess of 150 BTC! The ambassador of Panama also appears to be living here: https://www.google.nl/maps/@52.0902278,4.3074533,3a,28.5y,297.3h,89.4t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s7WGDGFooFNGWgmnMbvWH7A!2e0!7i13312!8i6656.

Having taken in the sites, I then arrived at the property where CM  are supposedly located. To say that the mansion was huge is something of an understatement. The ground floor houses a private gallery for paintings. The second and third floors house swanky living areas for the property's residents. I rang the doorbell multiple times, to no answer. I then wrote a short letter asking to be contacted, and posted this through the letter box. I am yet to receive a response.

My second visit:
On the following day (17th January 2018), around 19:00h, I visited the Surinamestraat again. After ringing the doorbell multiple times, an elderly man screamed through the letter box:

Elderly man: Who is there?
Me: Dave <Lastname> from <City>, I'm here because a company registered a website to this address.
The website is down, and has taken a lot of people's money with it. Since it appears that the owners of the website are unwilling to communicate, I decided to check the address for myself.
Elderly man: What are your contact details?
Me: <phone number> and <E-mail>.
Elderly man: What is your Fax number?
Me: Fax? I don't have one.
Elderly man: Mmm ok, so what is the name of the website?
Me: Coinsmarkets.com.
Elderly man: Let me write that down. Can you please read it out?
Me: C o i n s m a r k e t s . c o m.
Elderly man: What did they do?
Me: This is/was a marketplace where you can trade Bitcoin for altcoins. The website went down on the fifth of January.
Elderly man: Say what? Bitcoins and altcoins? I don't know anything about Bitcoins.
Me: If I may ask, there are two businesses registered to this address <Name company> and <Name Foundation>. Do any of these belong to you?
Elderly man: Yes, both of these are my companies. The Foundation was founded by myself 10 years ago, and bares no relation to the trading of Bitcoin.
Me: Are you willing to press charges against CoinsMarkets for fraud?
Elderly man: If it can be proven that my address is falsely being used, then yes.
Me: You can find this on the website whois.com.
Elderly man: Another young man also came here a week ago, and said he had lost money. Did you lose any money too?
Me: Personally, I have lost nothing. People who I know however are extremely concerned that they have lost a lot of money. Millions of Euro are currently being witheld.
Elderly man: How much!?!?!?!?!?
Me: More than one million Euro.
Elderly man: I will read up on the Internet about this site. If my address is being used, rest assured that I will be pressing charges. I will call you before the weekend with an update.

The below picture confirms that I was at said property. Further updates on CoinsMarkets will be provided in due course:

Well, "only" isn't the correct term - until late in december, network weight was mostly below 100 Billion. So the increase just means that it takes more and more time to get your expected reward, because to many small inputs are staking, slowing reward down for everyone.

Looks like the Chinese troll farms are already put into play. Sounds more like a personal vendetta against the owners of Electra. Your only posts have been regarding FUD against Electra. Exposing the identity of Electra01 doesn't prove anything. You hide behind a fake name. I assume you're busy creating some 'screenshots' to support your claims while you "protect" your inside source.

So Electra devs conceived an elaborate and expensive scheme to steal ECA by getting them locked in CM knowing the price would drift downward during the delays, and are trickle selling them on a couple other small exchanges even though they could have bought almost all of them when they began working on the project, and sold them during the massive gain --- and to further confuse the investors, they continued to remain active on social media, continued to develop and meet the road map, continued to add to the development team - adding to the website, getting github, discord, telegram and such running, whitepaper publishing and updating, etc etc etc. My God you guys are a new kind of FUD. Even Isle of Idiots has upped his estimate of ECA on CM to 20 billion lol.

No one ever told me to stake on CM. That would be stupid to fork over a big percentage to CM when I could have the full amount in my own wallet (which has worked flawlessly) I found ECA during last years big explosion, downloaded the wallet, & never had any delay in sending even up to 8 figures at one time of ECA from CM.

Putting your finger on your cheek while you ponder conspiracy's  doesn't make you a deep thinking philosopher. You're trolls, burnt by your irresponsibility.

Dear All,

Today there was a business dinner with a company which has $ 10B / year. The aim of this contact was to use ECA for their online stores and as payment option. The dinner was fruitfull and both sides were satisfied.

The company which is well known globally(almost everyone knows this company ) , will have some internal meetings in the next 2-3 weeks. Meanwhile, we hope to have some more meetings. Once agreed, &  they make an announcement through their official news channels, we will also disclose the name of the company as well.

Please understand as due to some NDA conditions, we cant disclose more info. We hope to get your understanding at this point.

ECA's volume is so low after coinsmarkets down. If you try to sell 25 million coin, it is about 1% of circulating supply, ECA's price will go to 1 satoshi. This means that selling coins at current price is not easy. Price is not fair. So ECA was dead.

@JohnDoe, Don't mind DDL. According to his own posts he just got into crypto in December, (as in barely over 2 months -yet has almost 500 posts on this site already) and only bought 20k ECA on coinscontrol Jan 6th. It's his very first correction market phase and we all remember how tough that was.

But some people will just keep on with the FUD and conspiracy theories well after the rest of CM is fully back online. It's just how it is. Once in a while just reply with facts in hope that new readers will get a better / fuller perspective.

Side fact: I had left some ECA to trade with on CM while the bulk of my holdings were safely staking in my desk wallet, and after 2 months of repeated "CM stole your coins" "exit scam" "ECA Devs created CM to steal your coins" blah blah blah, today i logged in and transferred my balance to my wallet.

Sure, as expected, but look at the transaction sizes. People taking losses on sales of 150$ or less. The largest figures are the buying. One person dropped the price by selling just 11k ECA.  Feel bad for the peeps who dumped there small holdings at a loss, just to see it double 3 hours later. It'll all even out after it goes up and down a bunch, then the coin can move on. Awesome growth ahead in my opinion.

Hi all,

I am following another concept and they just launched their exchange. Their started a vote to add more coins. It is free to vote  you just need to register to the forum.
It would be a great opportunity for Electra coin. I am also an electra investor I have an interest to see this coin in this exchange too.

Here is the link to vote : ADZbuzz forum

Feel free to use my link  to register .

cheers

It will vary. It is based upon your wallet "weight" which is determined by the amount of coins you have, and how long they are stationary in your wallet.
Once the coins mature over 24 hours in your wallet, your wallet weight will begin to grow. Your wallet doesn't have to be online 24/7, the days and weight will track and build, but having it on helps the network.  I've turned my computer off and still had my stakes calculate and arrive. I leave it on a lot because I want to help the network.  I've had stakes in as little as 10 days, and up to 18, but I have a lot of ECA. The most important part is holding, because your weight will grow each day and you'll get your rewards.

ot yet. Proposed. Community Coin looking for input. The approach addresses many major growth issues ahead. Forward thinking in my opinion. So many top market cap coins punting the hard issues down the road and relying on speculation and hype for $ and cred. This ECA update is looking into scaling, growth, inflation, community involvement, day trading volume and on and on. I hold a ton of ECA and applaud the hard choices for long term success and a solid foundation for $ instead of smoke and mirrors and hype.


Seasonic
March 01, 2018, 09:25:35 AM
ECA will fall below 1 sat. Its current price is due to whales that got in for quick profits last year and caused the crash of Coinsmarkets. Fundamental basis, ECA should be trading below 1 sat. There's a flood coming from regulators soon and only very high market capital coins will survive and others will go down the drain of mergers. A coin like ECA stood no chance of surviving not even when it's listed in the top five exchanges needless of saying is not even listed in one of the top exchanges yet. Lately, you hear the director of International Monetary Fund (IMF) Christine Lagarde saying on weekly basis that crypto regulation is inevitable. Once they dropped the announcement, it will be like a bomb to crypto world and a coin like ECA will be useless overnight. You can't even sell it for -0,1 sat like it was before the whales hype. No, am not FUDing but telling the newbies the fact cos the legendary traders knows the fact and that's why they are most active in the top coins right now. Good luck.

FUD
You want to manipulate the price
You do not argue any argument, you speak in general
You are not at all familiar with what happened in the cryptovalut market at the end of 2017 and early 2018.
People like crazy entered the crypto and bought it all in a row
All coins went up 1 to 100 times
ECA was not prepared for such a sudden increase, it has just started investing, marketing, opening up new currency exchange offices
You mentioned Coinmarkets, the ECA ended up at the Coinmarkets exchange office just because the NOVA EXCHANGE closed its doors where the ECA traded
I am a witness to all these first-hand events

You mentioned the MMF
This fall in prices has only happened because big players (world powers) enter the race and buy a cheaper crypto currencies again
and once again Crypto will experience its flourish will do the same, at the peak will sell, will drop the price and buy it again ...
this is how it works all over the world, World powers, rulers of the world, make money on ordinary people

I think the ECA has a future,
And they will survive those coins that will have practical application, and the ECA is one of them


sols March 02, 2018, 09:03:50 PM
I would like to make a post into this thread just as a post to point to in the future

after wrestling with some issues for the last couple months, I decided to move on from ECA, I still hang out with the community, though I wanted to help make a clear distinction, I was not associated with Electra01, I believed in ECA and our collective vision up until recently. I have my reasons, most are relatively subjective.

If anything ever happens with ECA, look for someone else to blame, I'm no longer part of it  

good luck everyone

Do not listen to the FUDers they have sold all of their coins and now want back in after the big announcement.

Do your own research on the coin. Electra has a very bright future!

It's like I said there are FUDers who sold at a small profit and now want back in. These people are incapable of having a normal discussion and  adding value to the community. They rather just complain than do something to fix it. I am shocked that these people have nothing better to do with their lives than to be nasty and complain on an internet talk form. What a way to spend their free time. It's okay to have a complaint but offer up a solution to help make this community even better instead of lambasting and acting all around toxic to anyone who disagrees with them.

Sad Dan here is incensed that I sold my 20 million Electra at a 200% profit, then sold after I finally got them off corrupt CoinsMarkets.
Of course, I took the profits and scooped up more Nexus - the coolest blockchain project in the Milky Way.

Sad Dan here is left with his purple coin Electra, reduced to pitching a sad pipe-dream of another social media payment system - LOL.
Of course, they don't know which one it is yet - they might have to create one.

And this dickface after selling his ECA in loss got frustrated to his balls and began abusing ECA like ECA is purple gay and other shit and began shilling about nexus...so I read about nexus because I know he is a loser and will move on after losing money in nexus also...but eventually I found nexus is 2014 made ...5 min block time and super slow transaction as of now...trying to ride fake hype...It made me laugh so hard on this dickhead who left ECA in loss and went to nexus with his dick in his hand.....

Isle of Groestl give it a rest, you made good money with eca, don't fud the coin when others are still holding for their 200%, these are fellow crypto investors just like you.

I sold most my stash but bought back at lower price as potential for x50 is very realistic once bitcoin gets going again and then there is the next.exchange/new partnerships/ and other investor rumours

Mr dickhead aka isle of shit or something like that sold his ECA in loss because he is weak hands. He bought ECA when ECA was nearing cent and was forced to sell because of his weak dick. So now he is abusing ECA.
He basically defined himself in his last comment n went to Nexus, a scam coin.

March 12, 2018, 09:03:18 AM
Maybe he didn't sold all his coins at once, I wouldn't do this if I was him. I had much more ECA and sold it in chunks or 1-2 mill so maybe he had.

March 12, 2018, 05:45:25 PM
Don't mind him. Read his posts. He shills hard whatever he owns or wants to sell, then trashes it HARD shilling that people are moving to whatever he bought next. He went from GRS to Verge (xvg was the greatest ever, perfect coin, going to overtake Monero, going to 5$ yada yada) then to Colx, then Electra now Nexus (which is still down over 80% from its ATH in Jan). He said he had 7k$ on CM which doesn't add up to 20 million in any form if he only made a small 200% lol. Either way the point is who cares. He's a drive by FUDster. They're always smug keyboard warriors. It's just a fact of life / annoyance if you follow any coins thread.

Hodl247
March 13, 2018, 01:46:42 AM	 #2287


Uh, no. ECA's volume shows that almost all of ECA's 24+ billion available are being held calmly off the market until after the bear market turns which is when the devs will begin making big new announcements. Hope you didn't catch a falling knife with Nexus, as the big pump and dump was a week ago with over $200 million in volume, now dwindled down to 2 million along with the price. Hope it turns around for ya. Even though you now trash ECA cuz you sold I still don't want you to lose your money. But no, there is no way ECA peeps are dumping for Nexus, just you.

PS: Are you the Cryptobridge micro seller trying to crash ECA price?

He took his flaccid dick and bleeding heart n went to Nexus, a scam coin. Quantam resistance is failure and its requirement is still decade away. 3DC already proven scam, satellite company and nexus has blood relation. so thats there. moreover nexus is bullockcart when it comes to speed. haha..and Nexus Price is falling like shit. Infact people from nexus are migrating to ECA now.

Lets study something about human nature.
when do we say bad words about something? ? only out of disgust or frustration or when we dont get out of something what we expected.

So no sane mind would believe that Isle has actually earned profit and after earning profit he began saying bad word about electra. there is no good reason for doing that. atleast humans wont do it. thats human nature.

the only reason i could of think of is that he obviously bought ECA when it was high. he believed in ECA coin but he is weak at heart, so he sold his coin when ECA began to come down and bought this nexus which was going ok when ECA was coming down. but he got late in catching that train too. now nexus price is dipping with each day and ECA is steady n rising back and this makes him even more angry and he is using more bad words here for ECA and its members.
he is a poor guy and playing catch up and getting more n more frustrated with each day. please dont give him much importance. he might be not in good mental health after all the loses. after all its hard earned money.

I hope he could come back to ECA because he believed in this coin before investing in ECA and should stick to it. He will get back his lost money.

Best of luck.

Good to see how few things for this coin is coming along. I have been staking this coin for couple of months now and must admit that it has been a smooth journey so far. I have had no issues at all and have been staking with any hiccups. I would say that if everyone holds their coin and less coins are available in the market, this will affect the price in a positive manner and we all can benefit from it. Would also love to see some new improvement plans and roadmaps to take this to next level. Do we still have an active Dev around this project as I didn't saw Electra01 in a while?

He got caught trying to blackmail the core team in the early development stages with his meager 20M ECA. After he didn't get his own way he resulted to harassing the Discord moderators on a daily basis. He's got a weird distorted perception of reality and a heightened sense of grandeur.

You're not wrong about him being poor and mentally unhealthy either. He lives in some run down old house in Virginia and threatens his neighbors with lawsuits telling them their barking dog has caused him "emotional duress" here ( https://youtu.be/pVrW3KCld_g?t=227 ), harasses ECA devs on social media - exhibit A ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yy3pi2wqgFw&t=2s ) and tries to over complicate his vocabulary during discussions.

He's a full blown raving nut job.

This is not an easy market to invest in, and the diversity among community members/investors is something that needs to be taken into account when making comments on public forums. Ty is not exactly a desirable person to deal with but is it absolutely necessary to post and ridicule him on this thread? I appreciate your drive to defend us but this completely goes against our core values as a community.

Please, instead of ridiculing him why don't you reach out to him and offer to talk things through? See what's going on in his mind.

I have a SSD as my C:\ Drive so always attempt to install wallets to D:\
The electra install program allows me to do this.

I then move the C:\Users\{computer name here}\AppData\Roaming\Electra folder into the install directory on D:\

Then I create a shortcut in C:\Users\{computer name here}\AppData\Roaming\Electra to point to that folder as follows

mklink /J C:\Users\{computer name here}\AppData\Roaming\Electra "D:\Full Wallets\Electracoin\Electracoin wallet\Electra"

However this results in a runtime error!

Other wallets work fine with the above methodology, but not electra.

Does anyone know how to get the DATA directory C:\Users\{computer name here}\AppData\Roaming\Electra off C:\ and onto D:\ ?

Could an option be included in the install program to specify where the data directory is located?

In case its useful here is a quick summary of how these junction shortcuts work:

Open Command Prompt as an Administrator to run these commands.
They create the shortcut.

/J is the Junction Switch
C:\{path} is the name and path of the shortcut to be created.
D:\{path} is where the Target files and folders are located.
NOTE: If spaces are used in the paths then that path must be enclosed in Quotes

Any help would be appreciated.

It will vary. It is based upon your wallet "weight" which is determined by the amount of coins you have, and how long they are stationary in your wallet.
Once the coins mature over 24 hours in your wallet, your wallet weight will begin to grow. Your wallet doesn't have to be online 24/7, the days and weight will track and build, but having it on helps the network.  I've turned my computer off and still had my stakes calculate and arrive. I leave it on a lot because I want to help the network.  I've had stakes in as little as 10 days, and up to 18, but I have a lot of ECA. The most important part is holding, because your weight will grow each day and you'll get your rewards.

MaxiCripto
March 25, 2018, 04:03:42 PM
Circulating Supply
23.879.810.284 ECA
Total Supply
24.746.966.837 ECA
Max Supply
30.000.000.000 ECA

With a POS of 50%  this means that there will be staked about 11.939.905.142 this year. So about a 1bill a month.
 But the total supply is  30bill right?
So in theory , at best there is a max of 6-7months of stake and then the coin reaches its max. So no more rewards?
Am i right? or am i missing something?
Is any fork in the roadmap, to make this coin stake again after it reaches his max supply? to keep this coin live ?
thanx

After staking hits a max supply, the only rewards generated is from transaction costs. By then, ECA will be much more expensive per coin.

Hello, I pretty new here, just signed up... I hold ECA coins on my destop wallet for 3 months and wait patiently for the staking rewards (around 30/40 days), getting better everyday. I went on Cryptaldash, registered and voted for ECA by buying 17,647 CRD tokens ($300 minimum buy), this will pump up ECA to 1160. Each time you buy CRD when vote, the coin get 1000 points. Question: like I said I am pretty new but maybe some one could promote this on tweeter, facebook, reddit, ect... and we could get at the first place pretty fast. Just to say but HTMLCOIN (HTML) is at 70,830 with 68,830 sign up! We are now on 17th place. By the way, happy to part of ECA future.

More - or less? If its more, that could be the case that you sent some coins away (to other address), and that a Change-address was created in your wallet. (This is the default mode if you don't set a "default change address". You can check this with the coins-control feature of the wallet..

GeorgiaCoin April 01, 2018, 01:27:53 AM

Finally withdrawn ECA from coinsmarkets to my wallet. Observed ECA has been trending many times last few days, Is there any news coming out?   I though they were trying to list it on Kucoin, any update on it?

Electra01 April 02, 2018, 05:59:11 PM
Today is Electra's one year anniversary! Over the course of the year Electra has faced many obstacles and has overcome them successfully to become the premier NIST5 cryptocurrency. Since the start of our existence we overcame a blockchain freeze, the Novaexchange takeover and Coinsmarkets blocking all accounts. Our largest initial miners, stakeholders and investors during the early stages of Electra have become USD millionaires. Today, Electra is stronger than ever. We have a large community and are listed on multiple exchanges.

The bonanza was a great success and drew in a lot of people which kick-started Electra with a large user base. For a short moment right between when we fixed our frozen blockchain and the sell-off that followed, Electra became the first cryptocurrency to surpass Bitcoin's (circulating supply*price) market cap, on June 23 2017, and no one can take this away from us. Since then, some of our June data has been omitted or deleted.

We are busy working on an update for the Electra blockchain that will improve security and make Electra eligible for atomic swaps via the Komodo platform. I am working with top-level consultants in order to ensure that Electra's blockchain is updated with quality. The community has been tasked with gathering data on node latency which will be used to decide whether to change the block time or not. ETA for this update is within two months and I don't plan to apply to new exchanges during this time.

Since publishing Electra, I have been highly impressed with the level of cooperativeness within the cryptocurrency community. Electra broke through the competition because of the mutual support between its users and its openness to newcomers. Some members of the community plan to set up a non-profit foundation for Electra this year which I will fully support. In the future, I hope to see Electra governed by the foundation set up by its own community. I will continue to contribute to Electra after the foundation is set up. The cryptocurrency world has changed a lot over the past year. Competition and barriers to entry have increased greatly. Electra has adapted to this new environment and will continue to do so.

JohnDoe3490 April 02, 2018, 06:55:32 PM

Congratulations on seeing one year. It has gone up and down but the community is amazing. Let's keep going!

I have my coins blocked in coinhouse exchange , no withdraw option. Any sugestions?


daniel76 April 12, 2018, 11:10:23 AM
Posted this in the eca reddit and it got hidden/moderated so I'll ask here...............


"Thoughts please,,,,desktop wallet to cryptobridge took 35 minutes.

25 minutes before any confirmations showing in the wallet then 5 confirmations in 10 minutes shown in the wallet to show on cryptobridge.

Comparison I can do xlm and xrp in less than 2 minutes and litecoin 10-15 minutes"



further I dont see anything wrong with this question and the reddit has got serious issues with over moderating, seriously off putting to say the least, what happened to free speech

NEW RULES OF CONDUCT maybe?

1.Don't post anything but glowing praise in the eca reddit


JohnDoe3490 April 12, 2018, 02:25:41 PM
Sending ECA is near-instant. However, the block times are the problem. It is a 5 minute block time right now. That means each confirmation is 5 minutes. It took almost two hours to get onto Cryptopia. It is a known problem that will be fixed in the future with the 90 second block times.



kiddo April 13, 2018, 02:44:56 AM
This is a good news in terms of tx/confirmation speed, but I hope the block reward will be changed accordingly.

Bobubil April 14, 2018, 12:34:28 PM

No one has lost anything. There were problems with the Coinmarkets exchange, but a month later the conclusion was opened and investors #Electra were able to withdraw their coins to a local purse.
Do not spread false information.

I myself could not withdraw Electra from the exchange Koinmarkets, but a month later the conclusion was opened. My entire team withdrew the funds. The conclusion was open for a month ... maybe even now, I do not know.
Funny comments, specially came the price to bring down what to buy cheaper =) Good try.

Great news with those three exchanges.I know they are still new and volume is low but time will be on our side.Rome was not built in one day.Wait and see.Same happened with Bitcoin since 2010

JohnDoe3490 April 17, 2018, 12:31:29 AM
Unfortunate news about the wallet. HOWEVER, the wallet was buggy. Unlike Verge, the team actually communicated the fact during the day of the release it was suppose to be.

ThepowerofD April 17, 2018, 07:09:13 AM
I can't argue with you there  I really appreciate that fact  along with many others I love $ECA

oleksii777April 17, 2018, 12:34:43 PM
Hello everybody. I did not even doubt that the coin would have more exchanges. The coin does not stand still. Therefore, we are waiting for growth. Thanks to the developers for the excellent work. Good luck to all.

How is going this project? Was following it closely but now, we don't hear so much about it like months ago...I appreciated the tech behind it



Digital Drug Lord April 18, 2018, 12:22:23 AM
Well what really happened is eca created a website called coinsmarket where they offered low fees. Then after people deposited alot of BTC the site went down

Then created coinscontrol which only sold eca when it came out

They also created coinshouse and robbed people trading

It wasn't until they said they were getting lawyers that they released eca but by the time they released it eca was 7 stats..

So now coinsmarket has like 1000 shit coins and they release like 5 shit coins a week

They still haven't gotten to the big coins like ltc  BTC eth

Yes they countine the scam

They claimed it was the great demand for eca that crashed coinsmarket well eca made it to cryptopia and look at it still 11 stats

That's bad

Nonsense.

These are just words, no facts.
What kind LTC / BTC? Are you serious? Project electra is less than a year on the market.

I take these events into account, but I can not be indifferent when you say that this is a scam coin.

I personally earned on this coin + 44,000%. + POS mining.
Electra has an excellent community, I moder RU chat. Very warm and friendly team.

And, by the way, there were no moments as with the VERGE, for example. No payments to uncles for advertising. Everything is always by the team, by voting.

starl1ng April 18, 2018, 11:21:41 AM
Lol, WHAT?

Coinsmarkets were operational before ECA launched and gained volume.
Here is the proof:
https://web.archive.org/web/20170428130833/http://coinsmarkets.com:80/news.php
A web arhcive's copy of coinsmarkets' news page that contains info about the launch date - 2017-01-11 (ok, the first coin was added only 2017-04-01, but still it wasn't ECA)
Besides that, ECA was added to coinsmarkets only last autumn, this thread cointains a post from coinsmarkets dev about adding ECA to their exchange.
Of course, you could think theories about their collusion, but man, where's your proof? They enabled ECA withrawals first, so that the haters would hate a bit less, but no...

I'm just tired of this nonsense here and in coinsmarket's chatbox.

I'm just wondering... the bottom of the new wallet's github page contains a roadmap with lots of unchecked items, like Send and Receive Electra. The base features. Are these features implemented? And what about staking? Does the new wallet allow to stake?




JohnDoe3490April 19, 2018, 08:36:14 PM
I currently have my wallet staking on my pc. Do I need to upgrade to the new wallet or can I still use the old one?

Will the new wallet be mandatory once the fork happens in the near future?

cryenthuApril 19, 2018, 08:49:46 PM
You can still use the old one for now, until the fork occurs. It is recommended though that you switch over to the new one.

My mate have been in electra for some time and i got curious. Wow am i sad i did not know about it in april and mined that for just one day at the bonanza! Probably roi of the rig in just one day if held to this year haha.

GoodHabitApril 21, 2018, 06:14:29 AM
Read the manual on the download page carefully!

GoodHabitApril 21, 2018, 06:29:05 AM
Unless there would be an update for the QT - wallet before the fork..

Actually, I believe that Exchanges will require that, because they couldn't use a wallet that only allows for a very limited number of addresses..

Compared to the qt-wallet, the functionality of the Desktop wallet is much reduced, good for newbies that arent interested in the tech... And the auto-update is, of course, a step towards centralization..

And I just noticed that none of the top addresses have transfered their coins yet.. So they are either waiting, or leaving their coins on the legacy addresses, or some are just missing the update, and might End up on a different chain..



Melvo937April 21, 2018, 06:33:32 AM
there is a specific date for the ico?

evgen3790April 21, 2018, 08:10:57 AM

My investment blog: https://evgen3790.ru/


JohnDoe3490April 21, 2018, 09:17:47 PM
Electra did not have an ICO. This is a community coin. Everyone essentially volunteered their time and effort to make this a great coin.

RSGA2000April 22, 2018, 03:58:28 PM
my question is the following: the new wallet will only have a 64-bit version or also open a 34-bit version since in my case I only have a 32 bit windows and the update tells me that I have to have 64 bit windows


kagami_April 22, 2018, 09:03:15 PM
It will work on your operating system. They will likely have two versions, either way. The answer is not to worry about it, it'll work.

JohnDoe3490 April 23, 2018, 01:33:13 PM
You have to use the 32 bit QT wallet. A  64 bit program will not work on a 32 bit. Go use the old version of the wallet.

linkdefeu April 23, 2018, 11:39:07 PM

Thanks Eca team for this work!

Hello.

I have a litle problem with this last wallet.
It close himslef this night and this morning he try to download the version 1.0.8

Maybe i'll disable the auto update because i lost one night for stake coz of this :/

	



HaynesApril 24, 2018, 03:35:33 PM
The new wallet is necessary for future developments like ElectraPay.This year electra will hit top 20 coins mc we have an amazing team of developers and community.

mattcwuApril 25, 2018, 07:05:28 AM
I'm confused, CoinsMarkets.com was confirmed dumping COLX, ALQO, SHIELD, and ECA. I saw the screenshots showing the deposit addresses and the blockchain movements. The COLX, ALQO, and SHIELD teams confirmed this. Why is Master Den (one of ECA's core team) defending CoinsMarkets.com and banning the topic for discussion on Telegram? 
What does ECA have to gain by illogically defending CoinsMarkets.com?

hameshsmithApril 25, 2018, 07:06:16 AM
This might be something to do with it auto splitting your coins instead of having to manually split your coin between multiple wallets.   Not sure though         

citisiaApril 26, 2018, 07:03:45 PM
Hi everyone   ,

I am new to Electra coin and I wanted to know could someone help me how to sync wallet either on windows 10 or Linux?

I have downloaded a new Electra.conf file as well and have replaced too with no luck.

Another thing is, I have read in some posts that there is going to be a fork for elctra. Will it be a hard fork? Getting new coins? How it will effect on my coins? Currently I am holding coins on exchange and wants to move them to wallet for staking. Will this fork effect my coins?

Many thanks in advance.

Regards,
Citisia

narandzaApril 27, 2018, 02:39:57 PM
hello

 
i am a proud owner of some Electra coins because i like your Project.
i downloaded the offical Windows Wallet and transfered my coins.
after the Installation and one day of waiting it started staking  (done the new config etc.)
my network weight was growing from day to day, and the time to the reward was sinking.


yesterday the wallet updatet it self, and there was a phrase telling, not to keep more then 1k coins in the "Purse" so i moved them to my "Savings"
after that i lookered for the wallet info, and now my weight is 0 again, not staking!?


is all my progress killed by moving the coins from one address to the other? are the 3 wallet addresses connected to each other?
do the coins have to be on a specific address (purse, savings or checking) to stake?
the status of my wallet now is encrypted and not staking... another 24 hours for the coins to mature?    

THX a lot

Electra01April 29, 2018, 04:47:59 AM
On April 20, a bug in the community-made wallet caused losses to multiple users that amounted to about 150 million ECA. This in US dollars is close to $270,000 at today's value. The community developers have informed me that the bug has since been fixed. Note that this did not happen in the Electra core wallet which has been working flawlessly for the past year.

Though I have nothing to do with the development of the community-made wallet, in order to protect the stability of the Electra ecosystem and its ensure long-term growth, I have decided to compensate all the affected users fully from the pre-mine.

I will not do a bail-out like this again. Please be very cautious when downloading wallets other than the core wallet. I ask the community developers to be more careful when releasing wallets in the future. That being said, the community wallet is highly innovative and I sincerely hope they will continue to develop it along with the other projects they have going such as Electra Social Pay.

The compensations will be sent today. For reference, I have included a spreadsheet showing all the affected addresses.

 







hienvienlangApril 29, 2018, 04:33:14 PM
Thanks for your noti  



bstewartApril 29, 2018, 07:28:22 PM
For mining, sometimes it can take a few days or so in order for your tokens to "mature." I assume that's probably the issue you're having - give it a few days and check back.

JohnDoe3490April 30, 2018, 02:22:49 AM
Interesting. So do you recommend not using the community wallet? Stick with the QT wallet instead?



kiddoApril 30, 2018, 05:21:20 AM
This is always recommended, to keep your coins in your desktop wallet or if is possible to a hardware wallet.

Electra01April 30, 2018, 06:48:48 AM
If you are risk-averse, use the core wallet. The community wallet is still being developed and, as its code is modified, may sometimes run into problems.

JohnDoe3490April 30, 2018, 02:19:53 PM

Alright. Thanks Electra01. It is very interesting that the community wallet ran into these problems. I'll wait until they get more updates and bug fixes in before completing the switch.

GoodHabitApril 30, 2018, 05:43:51 PM

Nothing particular about ECA in this.. If you run a full synced wallets, all coins will show incoming transactions ASAP,that is within a few seconds. (There isn't a reason why it should be slower than sending e-mail). Sometimes, you have to wait till exchanges really execute the withdraw...

But the point most people miss, is that all coins only become spendable once they have sufficient confirmations on the blockchain. Usually, if you send coins to an exchange, they only show up on your balance (as deposits pending) after the first confirmation.

Quote
Furthermore, I hope that a mobile wallet will be developed, because if that's the case I will become even more enthusiastic, if mining is possible in the mobile wallet.

This seems most unlikely, staking on a mobile wallet would require that you have the entire blockchain downloaded on your device, and are almost always online - if you have unlimited data, this might technically be possible, but would certainly not the thing you should expect...

dave3May 01, 2018, 03:59:10 AM
Any tips on getting the Electra wallet to sync?

I've got the latest windows version (64 bit, windows 10).

I've put the new Electra.conf file in place under C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Electra

(There seems to be two Electra.conf files to download, one from the website and one from a google docs link -- they're different and I've tried them both.)

I get "connection timeout" repeatedly in the debug.log.  Over and over.  I've let it run for several hours, and it won't sync a single block.

I've reinstalled, I've rebooted.

I've unblocked it from the windows firewall.  I've even tried forwarding port 5817 on my router.  Still no luck.

What am I missing?

JohnDoe3490May 01, 2018, 04:00:48 PM
Turn off your firewall completely. Connection timeout denotes that the wallet is trying to establish connections but cannot and after a time it will not continue.

dave3May 01, 2018, 04:23:20 PM
I've also tried turning the firewall off completely.  It makes no difference.  Still 0 blocks synced.

daniel76 May 03, 2018, 09:18:58 AM
Very honourable to bail out those losses I must say.

you say "If you are risk-averse, use the core wallet" which I assume is the qt wallet?

But community are putting it out there telling people to transfer to the new desktop wallet as soon as possible

which is it?

and who authorised the release of the desktop wallet, its almost like nobody tested it first! which version had the bug because I used version v1.06 to get around a bug in v1.08

and wow someone holds 133 million eca worth 200k then loses it because of a wallet bug  

daniel76May 03, 2018, 09:20:27 AM
which wallet old qt or new desktop

starl1ng May 03, 2018, 11:30:23 AM
I know the guy who got these 133M in person, so he told me that these 133M look like 'Mined', e.g. looks noone has lost coins from their wallets, but rather that guy just got everybody's stake reward, right?
Correct me if i'm wrong.

And yes, i don't think he will lose these coins.

JohnDoe3490 May 04, 2018, 04:32:22 AM
No one lost 133 million coins. They are fine and worked themself out. No need to spread misinformation.



GoodHabit May 04, 2018, 04:49:49 AM
To those who didn't notice how it went. At Block 76946 someone tried to transfer this 133 Mio to a new address - but only 0.5 ECA arrived, all the rest was considered FEE, and thus went to the address that staked that block, combined with the stake reward and the original input... Probably the others went a similar way, but don't now the block number.  So, in fact, someone got a much to high stake reward...

starl1ng May 04, 2018, 07:00:44 AM
Thanks for the explanation. Yes, you're right. It was a wallet issue, but the guy who received this fee is not a cheater. He was just staking his coins, and was lucky enough to stake this block.
Yes, this amount (133M) is much greater than the usual stake reward. It was even more than he had on this address. But it's not his fault, right?
Should he return these coins? I don't know.
@Electra1 has done the right thing by compensating the loss from the premine, but it should have been done by the guys who created this wallet.

lekleklek May 04, 2018, 08:05:38 AM
Does Electra have superblocks or does it just stake at a normal percentage? How would some one stake such a high amount?

GoodHabit May 04, 2018, 09:44:26 AM
Well, like with most coins, the system that mines/stakes a block usually gets the block reward + eventuell transaction fees, if there are other transactions. And reward and fees are just added together as one output.. In this case, the bug used almoust all of the sent amount as Fee, so almoust nothing arrived at the Destination address. And, as usual, the fees got combined with the reward..

I started to know your project, so I could not comment with the correct property yet ... but, here I will be here. and I want to know much more.
Meanwhile, I participate in your rewards program.

Hi, guys. Please explain how to stake within eca wallet. In which account I should hold ECA for staking - "saving account" or "checking account"

Thank you for reply

JohnDoe3490 May 07, 2018, 02:31:42 PM
Use your savings account. This wallet was intended for "saving" or staking for longer periods of time.

damn missed this cult gathering, are we talking 150k eca worth $300 dollars or $150k dollars, either way sounds like some homo movie.

are you the guy who released bobx token recently?


bober182 May 07, 2018, 09:10:52 PM
Is the cause of the bug actually identified and can it easily be removed to prevent that from happening again?

ECAFriendly May 07, 2018, 11:09:23 PM
Hello everyone,

My apologies in advance for the long winded post, but I feel it is important to be said. I am one of the many investors that are now stuck in limbo with Coinhouse.eu. Unfortunately there were many complaints about this site on twitter and discord, but I did not see them before depositing BTC to buy roughly 4 million more ECA to add to my bag. Apparently there was an issue with Coinhouse for week's and the Electra team took no action for over a month.

When I asked several Electra team members to contact Coinhouse, I felt brushed aside. After they contacted Coinhouse I asked for updates and was totally ignored by multiple members. I also suggested they obtain exchange owners identities before promoting their exchange and I was told that cannot be done because ECA is open source and anyone can list it. Well.. that may be true, but there is a difference in just being listed on an exchange, and promoting an exchange. If you don?t know the owners, it would be wise to not promote the exchange.

In this age of technology it is not hard AT ALL, to verify who someone is. There are identity verification services, several social media platforms, business registration documents, etc..

I am not saying all of this because I wish this community harm or harbor ill will. I am someone who is heavily invested in ECA  (bought at 55 satosh's) and never sold a single coin even as I watched it drop all the way down to 5 satoshi's. I just think the Electra team needs to do better and do more to protect its investors.

I am by no means a whale, but I have put roughly 10k into Electra and have also been building a marketing platform that I was going to pretty much gift to ECA and now I will be lucky if I ever recoup my investment so I will no longer invest in ECA. I am not important, but ECA will struggle to reach it's potential without investors like me and you will continue losing them if you do not protect them.

I wish you all the best, and hope the Electra team takes this to heart.

daniel76 May 07, 2018, 11:15:17 PM
I am going to post my generic response to this issue

"If you put more than $100 at anyone time into any of these small time exchanges with hidden Whois your an idiot"

I do agree that ECA team should not promote any exchange unless its binance or coinbase or some other top 4 exchange, when they going to learn i don't know

ECAFriendlyMay 07, 2018, 11:28:56 PM
Most coins start out on these types of exchanges. I made several small test buys before making larger purchases and always withdrew instantly without a problem. I (and others) got screwed because an exchange that Electra promoted (and still does in the announcement post here) stopped allowing ECA withdrawals and even tho apparently the ECA team was well aware of it, they did not warn the community. Coinhouse apparently informed them weeks ago and nothing was said to the public.

Hodl247 May 08, 2018, 05:09:28 AM
I have always considered any exchange a risk since I first started in crypto. It's the number one rule: You don't control your coins/tokens unless you have them in your own wallet. I've never assumed Electra was Endorsing any individual exchange, but just notifying people where ECA is currently available for trading. When I found ECA last year and went to Coinsmarkets I was super suspect as it was a gong show exchange, so when I made my large purchases I sent them to my wallet right away. I accepted the risk when i left a little on there. (And got those coins back when ECA stepped up the pressure on CM) I did a lot of reading about the other exchanges available such as Coinhouse and read mostly horrible reviews from other coin projects. It didn't take much research to find all the horrid experiences people had at Coinhouse. Major red flags and low volume.

I waited and instead did some trading for a lot more when Cryptopia came online, but still sent any ECA straight back to my wallet to add to my staking. Sorry you are getting burned, but if you leave $ on an exchange, you're accepting the potential loss. Learn from it, don't blame others. Like I said before, it's the Number One Crypto Rule.

ECAFriendly May 08, 2018, 12:13:58 PM
The problem for me and several others was that I sent BTC to CH to buy ECA and I went to withdraw it immediately and couldn't. I never keep my coins on exchanges and I have been a ECA hodler since I first bought it. I am not blaming Electra, but they absolutely could have and should have done a better job at warning the community and that is why I made my post. My losses as well as many other's could have been avoided if Electra just announced there was a problem with ECA withdrawals on Coinhouse when Coinhouse first made the Electra team aware there was a problem. Instead it took them over a month to even acknowledge a problem and countless of investors fell into the same trap I did.

Again, my goal with this post is to make Electra better. I am not placing full blame on them, but the reality is this could have been avoided for many and this is the type of stuff that burns investors on a coin. I want to see ECA succeed and hopefully they will do better in the future.

ZZ8ZZ May 08, 2018, 04:46:10 PM
ECA is about the become one of my favorite coins lol. Great community around this project + the Roadmap is on another level, I really hope that the devs will achieve everything that's planned.

PS one of the Discord invite links on the website is expired.

JohnDoe3490 May 08, 2018, 05:09:27 PM
I hear you man. Unfortunately, that is on Coinhouse. Coinsmarkets and Coinhouse all had working wallets and trading back in January area.

ELECTRA TRANSFER

Kindly help me, I was transffering ECA from CoinsMarkets to Cryptopia and received following EMALI message from CoinsMarekets, while coins was deducted from my Wallet. Please HELP ME

Your request to withdraw 9999 [Electra] to Ed6pMEdmHs18dyaarQZwRbnfAwBpnpn2JY has failed.
This can be reason to wrong wallet ,wallet maintenance , Coins in stake etc ...


Does CoinsMarkets still have Problem? Should I wait. I hope ECA Team might help the way they help before?

knatseb May 10, 2018, 02:13:51 PM
keep trying, ive read it might take some attempts till it works.

JohnDoe3490 May 10, 2018, 02:50:15 PM

GoodHabit May 10, 2018, 05:56:24 PM
It doesn't "still have a problem". All the coins of some value are most likely gone. So the standard e-mail you received just means - they can't send, because they don't have any ECA left to withdraw... ECA team can't actually help, because the top priority for CM is hiding their identity and not to be found. So CM doesn't respond to anyone.. May be the just opened ECA withdrawal (for ca. 1 month - Feb. 24 til second half of march) to gain time to prepare for an exit...

fsh457 May 12, 2018, 12:31:32 AM
Hi,

Does anyone know why all my coins has disappeared from Electra Desktop wallet with no trace!!!???

I appreciate answer.

Cheers


ECAGiraffe May 12, 2018, 03:46:20 AM
Hi there, check all purse, wallet, legacy accounts. Any new transactions in or out? Please visit discord #help section for more assistance!
fsh457 May 12, 2018, 07:17:48 AM
No transaction ... nothing in or out.

The wallet info shows for: Last received block: a year ago

Is that because wallet auto updated but block chanin has not been downloaded yet?

I am not in discord.

Thanks


koanado May 12, 2018, 01:19:34 PM

WhiteWalker1 May 13, 2018, 02:02:45 AM
take care. Electra Coin = Coinsmarkets. Both are big scammers. Please dont trust this "project".

hundret of thousend people have lost their money.


fsh457 May 13, 2018, 08:23:15 AM
hi,

How I can recover my coins using old wallet .dat file?

The new electra desktop wallet folder does not have wallet.dat file!!

Thanks


knatseb May 13, 2018, 05:03:25 PM
lol, another one who knows nothing, probably you sold at the dip and now you regret it so much and your foolishness makes you write only crap.

i know noone who has lost a single coin, all those who had ecas at coinsmarkets were and are able to withdraw them, i only know ppl who have earn money.


GREAT TEAM, awesome community.

WhiteWalker1 May 13, 2018, 06:57:26 PM
I never bought ECA on coinmarkets. Nevertheless it is very strange that just ECA only open for withdrawl and the rest with high volume like Bitcoin, LTC will not.

So if you have no idea, then you better stay out. And if you want to spread untruths here, check out ECA Twitter. Then you know how many have not yet received their coins and the Electra Coin cooperates with CM to 1000%.

And what about the thread here?
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2185903.860

Do you think this 200 pages were created without a reason?

Dont lie and finally tell the truth. Electra Coin = Coinsmarkets.com = SCAMMERS! FOREVER!

@ Electra Coin Team:
I hope your life ends up like many others who have lost a lot of money through your shit with coinmarkets. You are useless forever. Even if you give your Coinsmarkets Coins back to everyone, no one trusts you anymore!

knatseb May 13, 2018, 07:16:22 PM
most coins are being enabled for withdrawal, and eca was the very first coin to take action about that, never read to any of the other alt teams doing a thing.

and yes BTC / LTC arent able to withdraw, and i havent said that CMS is a trustfull exchange, but eca has nothing to do with it; and as i said, i know noone who has lost any ecas from CMS, some ppl has lost btc nd ltc like me, and im still patiente thinking that ill ever recover them, but blaming eca for that is just nonsense; and you can actually see how much has eca grown so far, and if you were participating as a member of the community and fallowing all steps they r doin you wont be saying that, cause you would be aware about mosly everything and the transparency of the team.

BTW, that thread is about CMS its oooooolder than accusing eca for having something to do with CMS when it crashed.
CMS is a crappy mosly dead exchange who screwed many ppl imo, i agree, but i dont agree with you about blaming eca on that.

Electra01 May 15, 2018, 03:24:34 AM

I thought i'd lost around a million ECA to coinsmarkets scammers, but ECA stepped in for it's community and got all our coins back, thanks to them (Electra) i have all my coins back, ECA are a project thats going places, Coinsmarkets are a scam company whos leaders will soon be going to jail, we have a lawsuit building that will nail them.

codemanX May 15, 2018, 10:48:05 AM
What's the problem at the moment with Coinsmarkets? I didn't follow since they reopened the withdrawal from ECA.

robo2 May 15, 2018, 07:36:21 PM
What it mean if i received 0.000001ECA from unknown address?

GoodHabit May 16, 2018, 11:53:56 AM
Probably someone did a test send - using your address (for whatever reason).

GoodHabit May 16, 2018, 11:56:02 AM
Coinsmarkets doesn't allow any withdrawals of coin with any value, anymore. ECA withdrawal practically ended late march, If you still have a balance, you get an e-mail (automated) that well (basically, there aren't any coins left..- so your withdrawal fails - although it's not officially disabled...)

codemanX May 16, 2018, 01:22:17 PM
Oh that's bad, luckily I have withdrawed all my Phore until they went down, in the end I just had some RADIA there, but the RADIA project was a SCAM itself so it doesn't matter I've lost these coins.
I'm sorry for everyone who lost money because of them.

antarmontar May 16, 2018, 01:35:58 PM

JohnDoe3490 May 21, 2018, 04:52:56 AM
Not enough liquidity to make a real impact on price. Buys and sells aren't meaningful at that amount of ECA.


emil1111 May 21, 2018, 09:04:30 AM
How much coins i need have for comfortable staking and what is %?

Gallows May 21, 2018, 07:19:10 PM
Is your wallet up to date? Sometimes if it has not synced with the network it will falsely show no balance in the wallet. Make sure that your wallet is getting connections, and that you are using the latest version, as I think they have released a new one recently.

As for the staking question, currently it is 50%, but that could change. You will also need a lot of coins to stake frequently. It took me months to get a stake with 200k coins.

JohnDoe3490 May 22, 2018, 12:58:50 AM
No begging in this thread. Go work to buy ECA or just sit on the discord server for ECA rains lol. Almost like begging.

yayat May 22, 2018, 02:05:18 PM
I don't think anyone is saying atomic swaps is going to moon ECA.  It will likely cause an increase in price and correct down. With each increase and correction the price should gradually rise.  Adoption and partnerships (which is in the works) is what will drive price up for a sustainable time.

Bobubil May 22, 2018, 11:24:31 PM

cjl1984May 23, 2018, 06:36:12 AM

Eca stacking is for whales only.
Unless you have a many mil wallet, you wont get anything.

I was staking ~ 500 000 eca for 2 month - and no luck.
Estimated wait time goes like 42 days than 28, than 18, and than 32 and never less than 14 days.

Network weight grows too fast I assume, so only whales benefit.

Just look at richlist: there is guy with ~900 000 000 eca, staking some 40 000 - 100 000 every two hours.

So, unless you have millions - not a chance.


OinasMay 24, 2018, 06:18:28 PM
Hi,

In the new wallet... How to get the private key / access to debug console?

BR Oinas


fsh457 May 24, 2018, 11:18:03 PM
Yes I installed the latest wallet and yes it is synced but still all my coins has gone missing!

How can I use my wallet.dat file to recover my coins in the new wallet as it doesn't have a dat file like every other wallet!

Thanks


Oinas May 25, 2018, 08:54:16 AM
Did you change something in old wallet location? When I installed new version, (I assume) it automatically sniffed the dat wallet / info from previous wallet's folder and imported the coins to legacy account in new wallet. This is just assumption but maybe something to try out.

	



Oinas May 25, 2018, 08:57:09 AM
How to get access to private keys in new wallet?

Electra01 May 25, 2018, 10:11:23 PM
In the wallet go to help > debug window

Click the "console" tab

Type:

I installed the new wallet while back when it was ready and same with everyone it worked just fine and recovered all my coins.
But a few weeks ago I noticed all my coins has disappeared and I installed the wallet a few times but still zero coin!!

Any chance I can use my wallet.dat file to recover my coins?

Thanks


Oinas May 26, 2018, 10:17:06 AM
That's clear but where is the help / debug console in the new wallet?
Or is there some other way for the access?




GoodHabitMay 26, 2018, 09:06:17 PM 
There is no such thing in the new (aka Desktop) wallet. If you wan't functionalities that you would expect from a decent wallet, don't use the new electra-Desktop-wallet.
(You can always start the QT-Wallet if you have a recent copy of the wallet.dat, and the coins that you had at the new addresses will be there, if your system is fully synced - just the labels - like Purse, Checkings and Savings will be missing...)

Electra is fully mined with staking only now. Open the wallet and stake.


skybot13x May 29, 2018, 09:50:01 PM
It depends on how easy those features are to use for the average user. If you need to be a genius to get used to that stuff I don't think it will have any influence on the price.

Agent-OrangeCH June 08, 2018, 07:25:19 AM
I'll hope ECA will be available on Litebit. Would be so much easier to buy ECA, when it would available on Litebit.

After 4 months I finally got some POS earnings   

codemanX June 08, 2018, 09:56:08 AM
It's true, Litebit is very easy and I used it too in the first few weeks of my Crypto experience but they have very high fees. Be sure you don't get much more ECA for your money on another exchange before you buy on Litebit.

onpoint June 09, 2018, 09:13:34 PM
I'm not familiar with that exchange. Yeah, the POS is pretty slow, but I hit about twice a month and usually a good amount.

neptuneniceJune 10, 2018, 04:27:50 PM
stay far away from this scamcoin . that is a team of stolers , sell off all your eca .

Reducing the POS award five times, I think, will lead to a short-term reduction in value.

JohnDoe3490 June 11, 2018, 03:57:52 PM
Reducing POS rewards usually results in a RISE in value, especially in sats and USD.

it is a good coin of scammers yes . stay far away from it . the police has an eye on this shamecoin . sell off .

Litebit is based in the Netherlands and almost the same like Coinbase, they just offer much more coins and for me it's very easy to buy coins there directly with FIAT money. The only thing that they should add on the platform, is the possibility to pay with credit cards.

@neptunenice

I still believe in ECA, although the Coinsmarkets.com problem that happend in January. When the coinsmarkets server crash happend, I had some ECA coins on the online wallet and I got every single coin back after they opened the withdraw.

I beg to differ and frankly, you make such brazen allegations without any substantiation or reasoning. Therefore reasonable to conclude you have an agenda unless you are able to categorically provide compelling evidence to the contrary and back up your post?

For me personally, ECA is one of the most transparent and honest projects out there, no surprise it has such a large dedicated and vibrant community, please take the time to check out ECA Discord. Sorry, you feel the way you do but it is most unreasonable to post what you have without any rhyme or reason for your statement. ECA has so much going on and such positive potential ahead. There are regular engineering calls that include updates and the reality is completely opposite to your post.

McAfee, once he was successful at his antivirus company, now he turned his life into this. A shame to use your twitters like this.
He invented his company because he was infected with 'Damage Inc' I believe if i got it right if I can remember.

Patricia Hoffman listed all viruses in her encylopedia in waaaay times back and it was a pleasant read to me, we could download it from the Bulletin Board Systems in the years '80. Before Internet got pupular.

Does anyone remember this?

Those were the days where a simple 'CMP AX,AX' assembler instruction, broke a copy protection. I did it as a kid.

I've been involved with ECA for a long time, and there is nothing that I have inherently seen wrong with the project. Sure, they've had bumps along the way, but the team always appears transparent, and continuously improve upon the project. I believe they always have the best interest of the project in mind. This is a lot more than I can say about a number of other projects I've been involved with / am involved with.

Unfortunately people would rather seek to blame others instead of taking responsibility for their own mistakes/actions. The down side to making people solely responsible for their own money is that victim mentality will become prominent.

Maybe they're investors trying to accumulate at low prices, or perhaps they legitimately don't understand the basics of wallet security and market cycles?

It's honestly mind boggling that people manage to come up with such bizarre stories instead of seeking to better themselves.

digitalblockJune 25, 2018, 11:19:12 AM
Hello everybody. I would not rush to such conclusions, the developers do not throw a coin. The development of the coin goes and this is the most important thing. I wish everyone good luck.

By the way, the community of the Electra project is slowly growing, the addition of new participants is always important for any project, as well as its development itself.
I think the community will be interested to know about the new partnership:

New Partnership! UniFox has formed a partnership with Electra project.
UniFox will implement ECA in ATMs, POS terminals and Local Exchanges. With this, Electra will provide its users a new way to access to its currency, while helping UniFox to spread knowledge and build the business around the world.

In the last two months bear market I saw ECA had a good ratio against BTC. Do we have to expetc the big jump if cripto world will increase in next months?

ANNOUNCEMENT

We are hard at work with the current planned fork. We have, however, decided to delay the release by another four to eight weeks because the product needs further unplanned modifications to improve its stability. As this update will affect every single Electra user, we feel it is best to be prudent and not rush deadlines by sacrificing quality. This delay will not cause any changes to the current user experience or staking. Our community can enjoy the 50% staking until we complete the fork. Below is a summary of the expected updates and the progress made:

Completed :
Reducing block time to 2.5 minutes
Addition of API calls such as gettxout and bip65
Staking reward to 10% (Note: This is up for discussion so may be changed again, we must consider this once again for the benefits of our project and blockchain lifespan)

To be Completed:
Security optimizations. (This is of utmost important to always ensure security is top-notch)
Re-adjusting of the difficulty retarget so delays in block creations are set to a 2.5 minute interval.
QT wallet fix - fixing wallet crash on initial launch.

We are aware that the above changes are delaying our initial planned release date. It is however, not ideal to have too many forks, and feel that this one should be done correctly, otherwise we would have to plan for another fork in the near future. We will keep you updated with more details in the next few days and again we thank you for your patience and support.

babbimarcJuly 09, 2018, 01:22:32 AM
Oh my God! From 22 to 18 sats! What happened? It does not make difference for me. I decided to hold ECA waiting for next bull market

aileen393332xe5157July 09, 2018, 01:28:35 AM
I read about Electra and see that this is a project that is stronger day by day. Expanding with larger partners and more mature features will help the project gain community trust and support.

Electra has partnered with Investa to incorporate ECA upon their ambitious, comprehensive crypto-trading platform.

Some of the services Investa offers:

MasterCard & UnionPay International Cards
Investa Exchange
E-Wallet
Europe & LATAM 2-Way ATM Network

bober182July 17, 2018, 05:34:38 PM
It's a lottery process. Doing the maths and then expecting the reward on time is wrong. It could happen that even if you are supposed to get a reward twice a day, you get nothing for 3 days in a row.

AltInvestor2018July 17, 2018, 07:42:04 PM
Specific questions on the staking.
1. I'm sure the initial $1000 investment has been well covered. Since the time your capital expenditures were covered, who has received the benefit of the staking rewards?
2. Is there some kind of condensed accounting available to view the total staking rewards received from the premine, expenditures, etc?
3. Whoever received the staking rewards, whether it be ECA or E01, have they in turn been staking those rewards, thus compounding the rewards? Or have they been selling them off?
4. What is the total compounded amount currently being staked as a result of the premine?
5. Previous discussions mentioned premine wouldn't be staked 24/7. How many days would you estimate both the original premine and the compounded stakes have actually been taken off the network over the last 6 months?
6. With current supply being beyond critical, why hasn't staking discontinued?
7. If E01 is the benefactor of all the staking rewards, + the compounded rewards, isn't the fork delay which he was in charge of getting done in his best interest? What will his plans be with all the additional staking rewards he'll be receiving due to his own delay?
8. How will the dire supply shortage be handled? ECA will be out of supply before the end of 2019. When will you decide to tell us what has been decided?

For a community that claims transparency, you have very little real substantial information available for investors. Anyone with math capabilities can see ECA in dire staits, but we're being kept in the dark on purpose.  Any questions about any of the above in Discord or Telegram result in being accused of spreading FUD & being banned. I created an account and am asking in here because it seems like the only place to get real answers.


	
sjt10July 17, 2018, 09:57:53 PM
Hello I know 50-60k coins is nothing when it comes to staking ECA but was wondering if 20-30 million coins is enough to stake and get a reward at least weekly?  Just trying to figure out if this coin is worth staking and investing in for the purpose of staking.  Can someone share their experience in approximates at least. Thanks.

nakashuJuly 18, 2018, 06:22:27 AM
with ~million of coins rewards are paid roughly every 20 days...

bober182July 18, 2018, 05:44:14 PM
True and that means with 20 million coins you should receive a reward roughly every 24 hours.

sjt10July 18, 2018, 07:08:21 PM
Alright, thanks for answering my question. So if 20 million coins should get a reward every 24 hrs or so, let's even say 48 hrs, why would a pool with 30+ million coins not staked yet after 2 weeks? The pool is StakeUnited

JohnDoe3490July 18, 2018, 10:24:04 PM
You can choose NOT to stake your coins. That's why.

AltInvestor2018July 18, 2018, 10:42:04 PM
Are you sure StakeUnited is staking properly? They could be doing something wrong. That many coins probably should have staked by now, if they're not moving coins out at random.

knatsebJuly 19, 2018, 04:47:51 AM
i have wondered the same but i prefer to be optimistic and wait the 4-8 weeks they said till fork is done.

after that if the fork is successfully applied, then staking reward will be reduced from 50% to 10% with several other improvments.

if the fork isnt applied within these time, it wont be taken well for the community.



kahleenJuly 19, 2018, 08:22:42 AM
The 30+ million coins from StakeUnited have not generated reward because the assumption that 20M coins generate reward every 24 hours is simply wrong. After generating reward, it takes 24 hours for the coins to "mature" again before even starting to stake again. I can tell you for a fact that 18M coins generate reward roughly every 2-3 weeks, on average ... with a maximum of 4 weeks. But you need not worry, if it takes longer to generate reward, the reward will be higher according to the network weight. So it's like this: wait 2 weeks to get X reward, or wait 4 weeks to get 2X reward. The only downside in the last scenario is that the X coins you would get after 2 weeks could have already started staking after week 2, whereas the coins you get after 4 weeks will only start staking after week 4.

AltInvestor2018July 19, 2018, 12:48:21 PM
Current circulating supply 26.4b
Average daily interest at 50% staking .00137(rounded)
They announced up to 2 month delay, so even only 6 weeks staking over this time is potentially 1.5 billion more coins in circulation.
That makes circulating supply 27.9b when they fork.
Cap is 30.
If they offer 10% for a year after the fork, staking during that time is potentially 2.79b, which leaves us with 30.69b in circulation 1 year after the fork.
While these numbers don't take non staking wallets into account, they also don't take compounding interest into account.
What they're claiming isn't possible when you do the math.
The question is, how are they going to fix it? And why aren't they telling anyone?
Another good question... When I invested in this I was under the impression it was a community coin, and that the community got to vote on decisions. At least that's what it says in the WP. Why is none of this up for a vote? Why is NOTHING up for a vote? Why is none of this even up for discussion, let alone a vote?
I'm not trying to start FUD... Just trying to get some answers to some really big provable problems with their claims and their math.


ColxplsJuly 20, 2018, 02:10:42 AM
The issue with Electra is that they're touting partnerships with ATM companies in ICO phase. Now, the ICO itself isn't the issue, the issue is staff are saying it has an existing use case, but in reality these will not be available for a year at least and that's assuming that funding is met. The final product does not exist

So, why do two existing ATM ventures need an ICO? The simple answer is they want to raise capital, however initial ATM fees could cover this alone, and why would someone be willing to use these companies when they can't even get a simple LinkedIn URL to work on their ICO page? We've been delaying the fork and "10B Company" for 4 months now and the roadmap keeps getting silently changed in the background. Better off waiting until this bottoms out and the team finally decides to reveal the partnerships.

Furthermore you have people like Aykut Baybas (Master Den) claiming that the team is solely concentrated on providing a use case, and that price action is secondary to this. If that's the case then we wouldn't have team members making contradictory statements like "timing of news release is key" (In reference to releasing this long awaited news in the bull market rather than right now). This is speculating that retail FOMO, investors who do not know any better, will pump up the value.

Another thing - The premine, and all the other large holders, are still staking at 50% rewards. This is going to leave us with a bare minimum of 29B circulating supply before the fork is finally sorted out, and that's assuming the team actually sticks to their promises this time around.

Seems highly reminiscent of XVG back in its haydays. In fact I even recall Sunerok mentioning Electra a while back.


ECA has gone from being a legitimate community project revival to a project fueled by greed.
Hyped up Vaporware.

JohnDoe3490July 20, 2018, 09:01:57 PM
  I don't see them touting them as existing use cases. Even their press wire says this.

"Electra (ECA) announced today that it has partnered with the UniFox project. UniFox will be Electra's second collaboration of the 2018 mass adoption campaign. This partnership will entail the direct listing of ECA upon the UniFox Network of Payment Kiosks (ATMs) as well as their Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals. The Unifox network has a global reach  -  incorporating over 6,000 ATMs and over 50,000 POS terminals in the initial stages."



AltInvestor2018July 20, 2018, 09:16:33 PM
That clearly says "has" a global reach, and makes the rest of the sentence mean they already attained those numbers during their initial stages. Hopes to have, or will have, or aims at would have made it the truth. "Have" makes it a lie.
AltInvestor2018July 21, 2018, 09:32:45 PM
...Crickets...
 I'm sure this will be followed by a 1 or 2 sentence post in poorly worded English complimenting the project.

Still try to recover wallet from mnemonic seed.
Wallet show: Recovering wallet from mnemonic...
After 3 weeks still not synct. Does anybody have a solution ?

ColxplsJuly 27, 2018, 04:09:54 AM
It appears that the team is simply dismissing this as FUD/negativity. Reality check: There would be no negativity if there was competency.
Regardless of how you attempt to paint this picture, the facts remain that the people in this project are still spreading misinformation about it in an attempt to prevent more cumulative losses from occurring.

We are constantly told "the fork is ready" and that "The Electra Foundation would take 3-5 days to set up". Well, why are we taking so long to implement both of these measures? It's like waiting for winter to arrive on Game of Thrones. Might I remind everyone that the initial founder is to receive all the staking rewards, which is closing in on 400M ECA now.

Staff tell us the project is doing great, but nothing has changed since December except for the new adoption of this garbage unprofessional approach to marketing. Attempting to hype and sexualize a financial product with blonde bimbos lacking any kind of cryptographic literacy is terrible at best. Why on Earth would anybody put money into that? How does this provide incentive to use Electra as an every day currency, or have we now switched our target audience from every day families to college frat boys?

We should not be sending people like Cassandra Hawkins (Electra Spirit) to institutional blockchain meetups. She has a degree in homeopathy and fitness ffs.


- Stake reduction delay
- Foundation delay
- Funds still not moved into multisig wallet
- Original core team silent
- Github activity stalling
- Founder keeps all staking rewards
- Overseers Ryu, VergeLife, Eca Giraffe and Zarag gone (3/4 moving onto new projects)
- Team opening bot party chat for sponges
- Team offering their consumers money to win exchange votes
- Price per unit below 10 satoshis
- False ATM announcements
- Openly shilling Aircoins, Unifox and other vaporware (ICO) products in chat

Where do you see this going?


AltInvestor2018July 27, 2018, 02:29:21 PM
You got a few things wrong...
E01 is staking far, far more than 400m. Think more in the 2-3b range.
You only listed the community overseers that have left, and missed the really important ones that were the real drivers and backbone of the project.
ECA Mom-Core team-Global Coordinator: She was a total driving force in the team. It seems to me nothing has been done since she left.
Ivan-Core team-Lead developer: His title says it all. His name has been removed from the GitHub.
Maverick-Marketing Coordinator: The only one trying to keep the community hyped and positive.

E01 needs to do whatever he can to try to get some of these people back. It's a huge red flag when key team members and long term supporters leave the team in droves.

JohnDoe3490July 27, 2018, 02:51:34 PM
Here is Maverick's Statement:

"I have received lots of inaccurate private messages in regards to me leaving the team. This is unfortunately true; however I want to be as transparent as possible to prevent any further false or possible statements from others moving forward.

Yes, it is true. I am sad to say that I had to step down from the team. Please forgive me as I do not feel comfortable disclosing personal information at this time. This has nothing to do with me going to another crypto team or the Electra project itself.


I'm a huge believer, perhaps one of the biggest, in Electra. This is something I never thought would happen and I'm truly upset. More so than you would ever think.

Just know that I'm very proud of the Electra community and all that you have accomplished, most importantly - the individual respect and comradery amongst members. Please keep up all the hard work and stay dedicated to the project."

riboku0105July 27, 2018, 03:10:27 PM Electra is about to announce its first ATM & POS partnership, of which ECA $ is targeting 3,000 ATMs and 30,000 POSs globally. I think the value of the ECA token will increase in the future.

AltInvestor2018July 27, 2018, 03:31:51 PM

Old news.... It was an ICO so it "might" be big news "if" this other company succeeds.... And those #'s for ATM's and POS are company projections for how many they "hope" to have in 5 or 10 years.
This announcement was worse than an announcement of an announcement. It's an announcement that only stood to do 2 things.... Try to get people to invest in the ICO, and try to make it appear like ECA was actually in a viable, usable partnership.
I wish it wasn't true, but it is.
It's the equivalent of my claiming to be a millionaire now because I'm invested in crypto, because someday it's going to moon.







ColxplsJuly 28, 2018, 02:48:55 AM
Every member that left within the same month said it was for personal reasons. I'm calling bullshit now - Nobody would announce problems about the project after departing. It's just not realistic to expect anyone to do that. Ivan, one of the core blockchain developers, has left and even Aykut has gone on holiday. Key members have departed from the project, the fork has been delayed, and the funds still remain in Electra01's wallet staking for his own personal gain. Why exactly does this person deserve hundreds of thousands of dollars when he initially wasn't even interested in getting involved with the community/project?

Hell, we're even seeing paid shills come onto the BTT to dilute some of the criticism going on here. This is an act of desperation.



AltInvestor2018July 28, 2018, 03:02:19 AM
Paid shill of the project by a non English speaker in 3, 2, 1....







AltInvestor2018July 28, 2018, 03:11:56 AM
.
🤣🤣🤣🤣.... This is so sad and obvious. Hope ECA team isn't paying too much for this crap. Every post that asks a real question or brings up a valid point is followed by amazingly similar comments in horrible English.

ColxplsJuly 28, 2018, 05:22:04 AM
First paid shill comment started here
Poor business practice.

RobofusJuly 28, 2018, 08:24:14 PM
It's ridiculous ... Aykut went 1 week on holidays and came back today ...

I am not against the negative opinions but hey I prefer not to answer when I see the critics since the beginning of the project.
Yet there has never been a real reason for FUD electra01 in 1 year and a half.



AltInvestor2018July 28, 2018, 08:59:19 PM
Great Aman.... Then you obviously must know the answer to why E01 is still staking the premine. The $1000 capital expenditures he claimed to be staking to cover  were covered almost a year ago. He keeps all the stakes personally, and he was in charge of the fork. You don't find it a direct conflict of interest that he personally is making thousands of dollars a day in staking rewards by delaying the fork?
Read back for 2 pages... What you call FUD are very real questions and concerns that you are personally refusing to answer. Why won't you answer real questions?
You give the same disrespect to everyone that even dares to ask questions, and accuse everyone of spreading fud when they just want answers. Difference in here is you can't ban anyone, which is what you do to everyone in Telegram and Discord who even dares to ask a question.
The supply is 100% going to run out before the end of 2019. This is math, not FUD. But you expect everyone is just going to ignore it because you don't want to talk about it. When exactly is the core team going to acknowledge this? How are they going to handle it? Are they increasing the supply? Lowering the staking? If they lower staking, it's going to have to go to next to nothing. And then what about masternodes? How are they going to pay masternodes anything when there's no supply? We're just supposed to invest or hard earned $ into a coin and "trust" that the team will magically fix it. The team that's lost THREE core members in 2 weeks, (Mom, Ryu, and Ivan), plus other important, long term team members like Crypto Life, Maverick, and Zarag.  I thought we were a community coin? I thought there was supposed to be transparency? Whatever is going on is a complete cover up, from E01 continuing to stake almost a year after he recouped his $1000, to the amount he's actually staking (over 2 billion coins), to the maybe change that HAS to come because of supply, to why about half of your key team members has quit in the last 2 weeks.
Aman, I hold you personally responsible for out and out lying to the community, bullying and banning people who try to find out the truth, and continuing to mislead everyone on what's going on. You're hurting tens of thousands of people who are invested in this. People with families to support, kids, school, mortgages... But you don't even care. Your only concern is keeping ECA going, no matter how many people your hurting or how many lies you have to tell.
The only team members I respect are the ones who've left.
At least they're answering the questions honestly when I DM then.

robertsebastianJuly 28, 2018, 11:17:13 PM
I see a lot of negative and bitter comments from your side in this ECA thread Mr. Colx.

I am able to counter every "concern" you're raising but first I think everyone should understand here that the comments you post are not coming from a constructive mindset. Happy to enter in a conversation or discussion with you if you want.

Let me tackle all points you raised below.

1. The ATM Manunfacturer UniFox already has capital and working ATM's. They need to raise additional capital to expand as they have huge goals set for themselves. As you may have seen, they met with the American Blockchain Association a couple of weeks ago to discuss possible cooperation for installing 50k ATM's that the association is planning to plant in the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxijjeMKQHk&t=1s

2. As you know, but not explain below, the fork wasn't planned on the roadmap. Only the atomic swap integration. As the devs concluded we need to change the staking algo as well as improve the chain, it was decided to plan the fork. As you know, but not explain here, E01 is working hard on coding the fork and unfortunately had to delay the fork from happening last month. 3 weeks ago E01 confirmed the fork would happen in 4 to 8 weeks. Any releases from the roadmap can only be released after the fork as we want to avoid duplication of efforts. The bigger partnerships with real companies, willing to accept ECA sa payment method, we have been working on and are working on behind the scenes will only be released after our product ElectraPay is released. And for ElectraPay... right... we need the fork to happen first.

3. Aykut and the team don't focus on price correct. We believe that a good usecase, a solid product and an engaged community will result in a good price. So... the price is not the aim, its a result. As we are all volunteers, our incentive is of course eventual price increase as a result of us doing our job good. If we see another bull market as in end 2017 we know that thousands if not millions of people will enter the crypto space and of course we hope to lure them into the Electra community. To buy Electra, become active as community member and of course spend their ECA at shops where it's accepted (usecase). The effect achieving the above by announcing all we have in a bear market will be way less then in a bull market. AS such not everything will be released right away. And you know what? If you hang out in the community, the vast majority understands and agrees.

4.It is correct that the premine is staking and that is a choice E01 made. For the investors, big or small, its their own right to choose. At this moment I am working personally on setting up the foundation which I expect to happen in august. Once the foundation is set and the first portion of the premine is deposited (300-400mln), the foundation will not stake that part of the premine.
Also bear in mind that ECA is a POS coin and therefore has no hardcap. Once the fork happened the staking percentage will drastically decrease immediately and all years after.

Eitherway, I admire you put so much effort and time in looking into Electra. I'd encourage you to investigate more and be complete in your comments about the project. My second advice is to spend all your enrgy and time on positive things in life. It gives you more joy and satisfaction, I promise you that!

All the best,
Robert


robertsebastianJuly 28, 2018, 11:32:44 PM
Hello anonymous keyboard warrior. Why don't you let me and the people here know what you actually like? And it doesn't need to be ECA (I dont expect that from you). I assume, by looking at your name, your project's logo is green? Eitherway, I commented where I could on your incredibly short sighted comments, a weak attempt to convince people why ECA is the worst project you can possibly imagine.

Again, perhaps we can do a live Q&A online where you have the possiblity to fire anything at me and for me the noble task to counter all you fire with facts.

I told the community this week that the lawyer adviced 5 days when we submit the forms) . Well, why are we taking so long to implement both of these measures? It's like waiting for winter to arrive on Game of Thrones. Might I remind everyone that the initial founder is to receive all the staking rewards, which is closing in on 400M ECA now.

(we are now 7 months underway my friend and in a bear market. We are doing great if you see where we are coming from (and Im not talking about price!! ) )

We should not be sending people like Cassandra Hawkins (Electra Spirit) to institutional blockchain meetups. She has a degree in homeopathy and fitness ffs. (Somebody from the team works in swimmingpool industry, We have people working in drywalling industry, I work as banking consultant, We have students, Mav is in real estate, etc. etc. And you know what? We are all passionate about the project and know a lot about he subject matter where some are maybe more technically savvy then the others)


- Stake reduction delay (no deadline set)
- Foundation delay (no deadline set)
- Funds still not moved into multisig wallet (what funds?)
- Original core team silent - Github activity stalling (Some activities we dont disclose in the open on Github to ensure it remains hidden for competitors)
- Founder keeps all staking rewards (no, E01 is also hedging ECA with other crypto)
- Overseers Ryu, VergeLife, Eca Giraffe and Zarag gone (3/4 moving onto new projects)    (Maverick joined, Ruru joined, Robert Bakker joined - Ryu is till with the project but not in the team, Zarag same)
- Team opening bot party chat for sponges (serious?)
- Team offering their consumers money to win exchange votes (
- Price per unit below 10 satoshis (yes   )
- False ATM announcements (why false?)
- Openly shilling Aircoins, Unifox and other vaporware (ICO) products in chat (its not shilling, its talking positive about partner projects)

Where do you see this going? (a purple future)
[/quote]


ColxplsJuly 29, 2018, 05:02:48 AM
Strange that you would take this personally, and yet again dismiss this as negativity. Do you have some undisclosed control over the project that we have not yet discussed? You and I have been in the back end and "ECA Influencers" telegram group for quite a while   We both know eachother well, and we both know that personal reasons aren't why Maverick, ECA Mom, Ryu, Ivan and CryptoLife left the project.

Consumers don't blindly spread FUD - They ask questions. FUD is false information, and you know full well that what I'm saying is not false.
When investors are given vague responses that are engineered to divert attention or confuse for 2 months at a time they become frustrated. A prime example is your clear attempts to dismiss me as a "keyboard warrior", and redirect peoples attention to me rather than giving answers about Electra.

Remember that day when we described ourselves in ECA Influencers as "A group of people who have a hard on for getting ECA to $1"? Let's not bullshit anyone on this thread - we're both honest individuals and should keep it that way. All conversations that display a direct conflict of interest were saved, just in case something like our current internal issues were to ignite.

- Price manipulation
- Buying false social media followers, comments and likes to assert influence over other projects consumer bases
- Coordinated hype in the lead up to announcements
- Back-end conflicts

 
  The list goes on.

I will object to your proposition of a Q&A as the last one we coordinated with Aykut on Youtube was pointless and I know any adequate responses would be considered a conflict of interest. Aykut gave the exact same vague answers to our questions with only an emphasis of it's a good community coin.

See last failed interview here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQWWP17TYns&t=77s

We don't need words we need action.

robertsebastianJuly 29, 2018, 09:10:59 AM
I don't take it personal but I do stand for the project where none of the current team members have bad intentions as you suggest.

I have no clue who you are since you keep yourself anonymous, therefore I cant verify if we ever had contact or not. But that's OK.

Maverick did leave for personal reasons and he can even return as soon as they have been resolved. I have called him many times in the past weeks and had intensive contact in the past days. The fact you state he didn't leave for personal reasons tells me you have no relationship with him nor ever talked to him 1-1, yet you state it firmly which makes your posts less credible as it's simply not true.

ECA Mom and Ryu left because they don't agree with the power E01 still have from a developer perspective in the project as well as the control on the premine which is understandable. These kind of projects stand or fall with trust. As long as I believe and trust the good intentions of E01 (I have no reasons to doubt) I will stay. But I can imagine when you loose your confidence you leave the project. You di dforget to mention that Ryu and ECA Mom are still active as member in the project? Ryu is doing an awesome job in helping the community in answering questions. Cryptolife wasn't very active so never had any chat with him.  and Ivan also was not very active so didn't talk to him a lot in the past months and has his own ambitions to achieve his life goals/dreams. Chat with them to understand.

Based on these conversations I wouldn't describe "the both of us as honest people" since I noticed you only post one-sided and incomplete stories. If that's on purpose, it's being dishonest. If you believe you speak the truth in making the comments then I can't blame you for being not fully aware or informed.
In the ECA influencers group I can't recall a day where we said to make ECA 1 EUR and I find it typical you try to throw these statements to me in a way the reader even may think its true. I (and everyone in the team) have the strict rule to not focus on price in terms of predicting. Price can never be predicted or set as goal as it is dependent on many ingredients from which many can't be controlled.

I would like to inform everyone reading this thread that the person Im responding to, who refuses to identify himself, clearly has grudges to the project or feels not respected in the past. A lot of statements or theories he or she writes are either taken out of context or untrue. I can tell from the posts that his person was not directly involved in the coordinators team but watched it from the outside and that's okay. I'd like to challenge everyone to use common sense, do their own research and by all means verify information directly at the source.

Master Den, Bob (The Revolution), Asmoth, myself, and more are working for the project many hours a day where most of us have still fulltime jobs. We wouldn't do this if we didn't believe the project has a future. Did you know Master Den spends 10 hours a day for already a year on this project for free where he gets regular offers to join other projects as community manager for serious amounts of money a year?

Yes we have quite some bumps in the road to overcome and these are discussed a lot of times in the teams and community. Yes in the young team that we are we also have internal struggles between people. Just imagine, trying to setup and run a project with people from all over the world that don't know eachother, work together only through mailing and having calls. Some people came with different intentions then others.
What I see now is that the current team has a big passion for the Electra project and it's community to play a significant role in the crypto/blockchain revolution all projects are currently being part of.

Again... yes we all have our bag of ECA. Some were able to buy very soon and have big bags, some have smaller bags bought at later stages (such as myself). If I may speak for myself.. I made my crypto portfolio exist for 90% out of ECA to keep myself sharp and motivated to keep on going for the project.

You may disagree with what you see or hear in regards to the projects direction but don't disrespect he people that are working hard, voluntary, next to their jobs with the best intentions. Yes, sometimes there are community members or even supporting team members that don't behave and have corrupt intentions, but those are being dealt with right away.
As far as you concerned Mr. Colx, I have no idea who you are and when we ever discussed stuff. I understand you became disappointed or perhaps hurt within the team. If I was a reason for it or some of the coreteam members I want to apologize for that. Again I want to invite you for a discussion or q&a and that doesn't need to be in public perse.
If you don't want this then I think it's pointless to continue because the conversation would become very one sided where you post incomplete comments placed out of context, me countering them leaving the public in confusion what to believe.

Take care and all the best,
Robert

!vanovi4July 30, 2018, 09:52:00 PM
In my opinion, the Electra community's rejection of the CEO and the Central body is a very bold and original decision,and the fact that decisions are made by the community collectively and always in the interests of the community is very progressive.

AltInvestor2018July 30, 2018, 09:56:26 PM
Don't let the hype fool you. The community has no say at all in anything that's done. Why do you think nobody, not even core members, can tell you what's going to be done about the supply shortage? They have to wait for E01.... The owner in every sense of the word. He has all the assets, he gets all the income from the assets, he has final say.... He's the owner.


JohnDoe3490July 31, 2018, 01:52:50 AM
Same reason why a boy with a new name fuds this thread constantly. Anger? Empty pockets? Who knows.


JohnDoe3490July 31, 2018, 03:26:11 AM
About the same as how much you charge for your fud LOL.

AltInvestor2018July 31, 2018, 03:44:46 AM
FUD...Fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Yes, I definitely have all 3. I invested a lot (at least to me) in this project. I was led to believe it was a community coin, and that I'd at least be able to ask questions and have input, along with voting rights. What I see instead is a community falling apart, key people quitting, and any questions meet with banning or being accused of funding.
My questions shouldn't be hard to answer. Maybe it's not important to you that the supply is going to run out and they apparently don't have any idea how they're going to deal with it, but as an investor it matters to me. Any day now they could announce a decision that could dump the price. That matters to me.
Key team members leaving in droves all of a sudden matters to me. There's something wrong, and they're hiding it.
The founder who's supposedly not the "owner" keeping 100% of company profits after claiming to only be staking to cover $1000 matters to me.
I, unfortunately, bought high, so don't have the luxury of just dumping my holdings. I do however remember reading that this is a community coin. My questions deserve to be answered, and I deserve to have my vote counted on the direction ECA takes, as its stated in the white paper.
We all do.
It's time more of us investors stood up and demanded our rights. Our right to vote, our right to have a say, a right to have our questions answered.
Not ridiculed or accused of spreading FUD because we're asking questions.

kiddoJuly 31, 2018, 06:53:13 AM
I know what you feel brother, I invested at a peak in other project and I am in the same situation. Unfortunately you can't do nothing about it, the only thing you can do is waiting because if you don't sell you don't loose anything. Another thing is to remember: don't invest what you can't affort to lose.

Coinmaster87July 31, 2018, 06:29:05 PM
come with your original ID....grow some balls and dont come as newbie....dont FUD unnecessarily....evry coin is bleeding...in comparison to that ECA is standing tall...team is working hard...

robertsebastianAugust 01, 2018, 10:46:15 AM

The documentation to setup the foundation lies with the lawyer firm. Next week I expect to have a meeting with the Dutch Tax Authority to proactively engage them with our plans. In the Articles of Association, that will be published after the go live, we will unfold our plans on how to ensure the community is represented in the board and especially in the decisionmaking process.

Secondly... The entire team exists of community members joining (and sometimes also leaving). E01 only works on the blockchain. It's the Team, existing of community members, that eventually decide the path to go. One example I can give though is from earlier this year where we had a non-responsibe exchange (Yobit) while we paid the listing fees. We made a community vote on Discord and eventually the community decided to withdraw our application.

Of course we still have to grow as team and project and the community engagement, especially how this is going to be done, has to develop as well. Our Community Governance team has the task to shape and implement this. Again, first big step is the foundation.

Most of your statements are false or out of context. I will comment in red below. (quoted and commented in red)


AltInvestor2018August 01, 2018, 01:57:51 PM

Thank you Robert. You are the only one in the team to acknowledge my concerns, and give me at least some answers. While I disagree with a couple of the opinions, I respect you for treating me as an actual investor with valid concerns.
It would be great if other team members would follow your example and treat investors with the same professionalism you have shown.
Great news on the Foundation formation, and I will indeed be listening on the call today.
Thank you again.


RobofusAugust 01, 2018, 09:59:17 PM
Yes, we thank Robert!

The only problem is that when there is always the same question, it is difficult to manage and only the fork will reassure people who are afraid.   

I advise you to read at least all the messages electra01 to understand the project and if you can read the whole subject even if it is long it is even better.

only "electra01" message = https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=944561;sa=showPosts;start=220

(starts with the end for the oldest first)

Good luck and try to understand the interests of what comes out of the panic/fud now that the price has fallen (and not before)   



kiddoAugust 02, 2018, 05:46:17 AM
Congratulations for the SHARDAX listing guys, devs and community members! Keep up the good work as it was until now, you are amazing! Eventually ECA will hit a top exchange is just a matter of time,  because the developement of the project is good, the community is good.

Electra01August 03, 2018, 04:50:26 PM
Thank you for the fast action Electra01. The BTC funds have been received by me and converted to 2.663,85 EUR via Coinbase.
The funds will be fully used to pay the lawyer, notary, address registration, translation of the Articles from dutch to english, server cost to run the wallet for the funds, etc.
All made cost will be in the bookkeeping of the foundation once established.

JohnDoe3490August 10, 2018, 04:17:31 AM
Looks great. Can't wait to use it in person and get Electra.


argakiigAugust 10, 2018, 12:36:18 PM
Updated news from StakeUnited.com 10/8/2017
"News regarding Electra (ECA): ECA is a low ROI% (~50% a year) long term project with a current coin supply of 26 896 536 442 ECA. In our pool the biggest input right now is around 48 000 000 ECA! But as you can see this is still a relatively small amount compared to the total circulating supply. These 2 facts lead to the point that it takes around 2 weeks for the ECA wallet to get a stake reward. We talked with many community members who solo staked ECA before using the pool :cu:  and they had to wait months for their first solo stake! So 2 weeks is already pretty quick! Like stated in our FAQs withdrawals are processed every 24 hours IF a stake was produced. We always try to have a reserve for withdrawals as well to do withdrawals even if a wallet haven't staked yet, but obviously we can't destroy an input which matured 5 days already just because of a single withdrawal exceeding the reserve. Please use multiple small ECA withdrawals if you want to withdraw ECA before it generated a stake reward. If you don't like to wait for ECA stakes feel free to look into all the other coins in our pool - most of them generate stake rewards once an hour :thumbsup: :moneybag: :rocket: "
This seems to be good for ECA developers. I feel happy

themonkiiAugust 10, 2018, 05:06:15 PM

Great. Thanks for sharing. I tried StakeUnited for ECA, but was told in the discord chan that they had stopped it, but it seems like that was misinformation.
I can say that I hit a stake about every 30 days with a balance of 1.7Mill.

I'll send some over later and try again.

	



dandan1010August 11, 2018, 12:17:33 AM
Hi. This coin not have masternodes? And what is next plan to make this coin grow this year? Any new exchange is planned?

thuesdaybAugust 11, 2018, 01:04:09 PM
what's the difference between checking savings and legacy account?

JohnDoe3490August 13, 2018, 02:55:04 AM
Legacy account is the QT wallet account. Checking and Savings are different accounts on the new wallet.



cjcryptAugust 15, 2018, 12:02:28 PM

what is the use case for eca? sorry i been searching around on website and missed it i guess.


JohnDoe3490August 15, 2018, 02:22:48 PM
It is just another fast coin right now. Other than that, some stores accept ECA.

Jacek10August 15, 2018, 05:17:23 PM
nothing special coin normal like 500 others

gamichvocheAugust 15, 2018, 05:26:08 PM
Nice ICO, but planning is not well established.

NotHatinJustTrollinAugust 16, 2018, 10:53:50 AM

SWAP is just a way for this special problem, if they didnt want to airdrop currency it would be easir decisions  no matter token or new coin.
my opinion is devs should use my ECA for that, but also add feature to keep their token safe on my ECA so people dont need then to send ETH address right away if they dont want
myECA can be built a multy functional platform in time if devs decide it and see it fit in their plans


RcvlielandAugust 17, 2018, 11:22:30 AM
ECA did not have an ICO. We encountered the issue that we needed to fork the blockchain in order to realise our roadmap. Therefore there is some delay at this point but we communicate openly about it.



ColxplsAugust 18, 2018, 06:32:12 AM
 

Remember when the Electra team said Maverick left for personal reasons?

Surprise surprise, they lied yet again. What happened to the days of transparency?

You can't really blame him for leaving for another project though. It would be very frustrating trying to deal with an incompetent and deceptive business team. They've done a pretty good job at keeping people holding while the max cap and inflation controls haven't been implemented. Just a reminder for investors that the long-claimed 30 billion ECA max supply is actually false, and is actually unlimited until the hard fork is released. Also, don't forget that the recent business partners are run by team members.

It appears that the most recent deceptive business tactics are to have team members create a new startup company, remove their faces from the Electra website, and announce a partnership. Let's not even get started on Tekin Akdeniz's admissions of spoofing/botting the charts on CryptoBridge during the previous dump. The SEC is going to have a great time with that one.

This is endorsed shilling enabled by individuals such as Robert Bakker and Aykut Baybas.

- Maverick joining new team. Also displays that he founded the company most recently announced on Electra forums.

kiddoAugust 20, 2018, 06:36:31 AM
Tbh I don't care about a dev who left for another project, it happens all the time on this space. The good thing is that the project was not abandoned and is still working and developing further. As about the max supply my personal opinion is that this is actually a good thing with no cap, because when you'll reach max cap and you won't get the 50% of what you hold, many people will sell and leave, because no one is staying here for just the fees which is only dust.

JohnDoe3490August 20, 2018, 02:24:02 PM
LOL. He is an ADVISOR. He is still an advisor. Whoosh.

We are pleased to announce that $ECA will be listed on the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbene during the first half of September! Their top 50 ranking with a volume of over $330M/day will be a huge step forward in our ecamassadoption campaign



Electra01September 01, 2018, 02:18:46 AM
Yes, I can confirm the news about Coinbene is correct. Payment for listing was made from the pre-mine. Coinbene is a transparent exchange and, despite its short existence, became the highest ranked exchange in the world during June and has remained in the top-tier since this achievement. It is truly fantastic that Electra will, in a few days, be in a listed on a Class A exchange which currently has daily volume at the same level as Bittrex and higher than Poloniex.

Btc_1856September 01, 2018, 02:55:59 AM
Great to hear the news from you because you are thinking a lot for the community. Most of the companies will not bother about the listing in good exchange but you are listing in very good exchange for trading.

	

aileen393332xe5157September 01, 2018, 03:03:10 AM

I think so! The ECA's achievement will make it profitable for investors to invest in this project. The community has strong project support, the coin will rise...

	



JordanCaSeptember 01, 2018, 03:04:22 AM
the very name of the topic already speaks for itself and that is all said. I think if the team succeeds, it will be very popular in the market. It'simportant for the community.

Coinmaster87September 02, 2018, 06:44:50 PM
yeah...thats great news for ECA and ECA community.....
Also, we all are desperately waiting for positive fork update. I hope you will write soon.



Divine Bitch DianaSeptember 02, 2018, 06:46:57 PM
Thanx ECA for making me 14k on the rise last December -
bought more Nexus with it.

Bitspace in Norway just partnered with Nexus. So the price is sneaking back up again.
Conference in Scottsdale this month, satellites going up in March.

I do still have a warm place in my heart for what ECA did for me back in the day    

I miss her purple aura, but I like money more.

JohnDoe3490September 03, 2018, 04:49:18 AM
I have never used coinbene. Still only want binance. When?

RobofusSeptember 03, 2018, 03:18:02 PM
no information on binance yet
It will have to wait the fork and electrapay to attract binance   




shastusSeptember 04, 2018, 05:41:12 AM
So I'm positive that Eca is now listed on Coinbene. That's going to be in the near future and it does not have to be that Binance is always considered the best exchange.

I think you should give Coinbene a chance :-)

ShumanSeptember 04, 2018, 06:45:36 PM
Hi there!

What about MVP and integration ECA to the POS and others payment terminals? I thought this token will innovative decision in the crypto-to-real world... but as I see, the project slowly limping somewhere behind the competitors.

Coinbene isn't necessary step right now, there are a lot of markets with ECA. Honestly, don't understand the reason for listing...

Best wishes!

RobofusSeptember 04, 2018, 09:27:27 PM
it's not the same team that takes care of being listed everywhere
and the development team

Being listed on Coinbene will allow people (in Asia) to easily join Electra

Awwad MichaelSeptember 04, 2018, 09:41:55 PM
Project seems very hot, I want to know, when the bounty campaign ended, your bounty business looks very tempting, I try to look at the effect because of the best conditions provided by the team!

ShumanSeptember 04, 2018, 10:10:25 PM
Hi there!

Without development, this project, like others, hasn't future despite on a lot of exchanges. I don't think the team will reach every item of RoadMap in Q3. There is remains less than a month, so, the actual questions are:
Where is the Atomic Swap? Masternodes? Web wallet and other points?

Best wishes!

cryenthuSeptember 05, 2018, 12:58:39 AM

Please be sure to watch the ECA Engineering Call(s). All of your questions and concerns are answered there.

Thank you for the link. I've subscribed now. Many water was in her speech, therefore many of my questions were answered. Will watching on the progress. But there was no word about the Web Wallet. When the team intends to launch it?

Thanks for the reply,
Best wishes!


ColxplsSeptember 08, 2018, 11:59:35 AM
Note that Coinbene is notorious for wash trading (fake volume).

If investors thought FatBTC wash trading was bad wait until they use Coinbene.

duke944September 10, 2018, 05:32:09 PM
ECA incredibly proud of the Electra community for raising funds towards Binance's flood relief campaign for Japan.

ECA would like to thank our community and Binance for coming together to help Japan recover from this disaster.

ShumanSeptember 10, 2018, 11:37:56 PM
Hi there!

I was surprised that ECA does so many things for the uncrypos people. Amazing!   
When ECA will be listed on Binance? Maybe we should raise the community to vote ECA? Let's do it guys! bring ECA to the biggest marketplace!

Best wishes!


kolinkoSeptember 12, 2018, 04:38:07 AM
Update with regards to the foundation ECA.

Final documents are released by the notary and now under review by the board members and e01.

Once approved by us, the notary signs on our behalf resulting in the foundation being setup. That process should take maximum 2 days after approval.

Regards on behalf of the team ECA.

I would believe that they do not hold any specific restrictions for participation in investments. I think anyone who passes their КYC will be able to trade. Maybe the team can comment?

ErolTSeptember 12, 2018, 10:09:54 PM
Yes, finally : )

LisaSilvSeptember 12, 2018, 10:14:06 PM
As every one know that to stake the coin through the staking pool the staker dont need power,system,or other connectivity but if we want to stake the same coin with out using staking pool means do we need minimum coins to stake and we need system to run???






jerry3k5jamiso1September 13, 2018, 02:50:12 AM

ShumanSeptember 14, 2018, 02:17:01 PM
Hi there!

I hope you are right)
Have an other question for the devs. How do you intend to control the inflation? What do you think about token burn? in my own opinion it's neccesary step to decrease the volatility

Best wishes!

cryenthuSeptember 14, 2018, 08:54:21 PM

Hi, Shuman.

The hard fork will change how inflation is controlled.

     Year 1 ---> 2.5%
     Year 2 ---> 1.25%
     Year 3 ---> 0.63%
     Year 4 ---> 0.31%
     Year 5 ---> 0.016%
     Year 6 ---> 0.008%
     Year 7 ---> 0.004%
     Year 8 ---> 0.002% and ongoing

Hope this help.

Cheers.

	



Electra01September 15, 2018, 12:45:31 PM
One of the members of the Electra community is organizing a bicycle tour around the USA which kicked off several hours ago in Long Island and will end in California. The Tour de Crypto's goal is to raise $1,000,000 USD via cryptocurrency and USD for the Houston Area Women's Center (HAWC) which aims to prevent domestic violence against women. 100% of the donations will go directly to HAWC via wallets maintained and controlled by HAWC. The Tour will not receive any part of cryptocurrency donated. The Tour de Crypto organizers also aim to encourage more charities to accept cryptocurrency donations.

The Tour de Crypto will take more than a month to complete and will be televised. I wish the organizers the best of luck in this selfless endeavour and encourage our community to donate to this cause. I will make a donation during the event.

Hi there! Thank you for the reply, but I've asked about burn system. will the team implement it in the future or not?

Also, I have another question. My ECA wallet stopped work normal. Have you any suggestion what should I do to repair it? The daemon couldn't start and I don't know why
Thank you,
Best wishes!

ShumanSeptember 17, 2018, 04:11:36 AM
Hi there!

I like the ECA's way to a charity. Often we forget that each of us sometimes needs help. I think to help or not is the own decision for anyone, but my choice is to help! Let's do the world better! we are - humanity - deserve happiness and equal!

Best wishes!

ErolTSeptember 17, 2018, 03:49:36 PM
I hoped/thought that the volume should be much higher as it is right now on coinbene : (

GoodHabitSeptember 17, 2018, 05:47:31 PM
Why should it be higher? People who know Electra and want to buy more could do so at Cryptopia - and other exchanges. A large exchange CAN reinforce a ongoing PUMP, if many people - mostly motivated by FOMO, decide on short notice to buy... But to get to a pump, you either have to win a LOT of attention OR have real whales pumping the price...

kolinkoSeptember 17, 2018, 06:30:15 PM
At long last, we are thoroughly pleased to announce that the first phase of the hard fork has been scheduled to happen at block #112200. Due to block lengths affecting time, it's better for accuracy to provide the community the block number as to when the hard fork shall occur. With that being said, we urge the community to make all necessary arrangements before this block is reached, which includes updating your wallets to latest versions. We are anticipating this Wednesday for the release of the new wallet updates. Both the QT & the new Desktop Wallet will be supported in the fork. In addition, the process of notifying exchanges and other platforms have begun. Please keep an eye on our website for further instructions coming this week. Current staking of 50% will remain until the fork, even after you upgrade to the newer wallets.

POS Reward Changes
     year 1 ---> 2.5%
     year 2 ---> 1.25%
     year 3 ---> 0.63%
     year 4 ---> 0.31%
     year 5 ---> 0.16%
     year 6 ---> 0.08%
     year 7 ---> 0.04%
     year 8 ---> 0.02%  and ongoing

@Electra01

To show the trustworthy of this project you should have a linked in profile, as many of the other team members already have. This would probably prevent people from calling ECA a scam and give new investors more trust into the project. Its just for the reason, that there are a lot of projects out there which are only made as a scam and people often look at the teams and if they are registered (e.g. at linkedin) at first sight.

Of course thats just my opinion, but maybe you should think about it...

kolinkoSeptember 30, 2018, 01:22:31 AM
ECA now less than 1000 blocks away from our upcoming fork at block 112200!

Please ensure that you have upgraded your wallet to v1.3 to ensure there are no issues after the fork has completed.

All wallets at https://electraproject.org/wallets have been upgraded for the fork


kiddoOctober 03, 2018, 12:58:28 PM
Hello mate and welcome to the Electra family! I hope you'll make some profits and be grateful to Electra Project.

BTW the videos links doesn't work, it says: "This video has been removed by the user"

victilumOctober 04, 2018, 07:54:14 AM
I can't get the new wallet to ever sync.  Active connections are: 0.

Here are some observations:

I can tell it reads the old wallet.dat just fine since the recent "transactions" appear in the wallet, but with zero confirmations.

I tried adding in the config file I found here:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yPBzR9LF3Z6y7QggHo8D6u5qKVUO7CfP/view

and here:
https://electraexplorer.com/status

... but when I start up the wallet, that file gets re-written with a shorter addnode list.
It gets re-written whenever the wallet is restarted ... so there seems to be no way to hold any new addnodes.

While hovering over the little globe, I can see that there are zero active connections, but on one occasion I did see it change to a "1" active connection for a split second, then it went back to zero.

I can ping some of the addnodes on the list (like: 137.74.196.251) and they give a reply.  So, my PC is connecting.

The machine is running win7 32-bit.  
The processes that are running are:
electrad-win32-ia32.exe, and Electra Desktop.exe (three of these)

... but the wallet remains with zero active connections, and therefore no sync.

(the old wallet had been working fine for me, up until a few blocks ago)

Hi There!

I don't understand opinions like this. If you're blaming project and say that it's a scam you have to provide a very serious evidence. In another way, your post doesn't carry any sense.
ECA a quite good project, not the best, but not the worst...  and obviously, you haven't done any research(visit the site, social media, read WP etc.)
Yes, the things could go much faster, we all waiting for mass adoption. Just keep patient and follow the news and, please, don't spread FUD and nonsense

Thank you

Thanks for the nice talk, Electra01

I think with this conversation I and many others now have the answers to the many unanswered questions. I ask this again to confirm here.

As mentioned in the earlier post on the 250K giveaway, here is yet ANOTHER way for you to get some FREE ECA. Have you seen the banners? Have you heard the hype? Have you been uncertain it would be real? Think again! This event is now official and sponsored by the team and the Sonamy Squad. We will ensure this event takes place, and that the ONE MILLION ECA is rained. How do you qualify? Easy! Simply just be there! Event will take place Friday Nov 9th at about 5PM PST, or about 00:00 UTC as the clock turns to Sat the 10th. This added event now totals almost 3 MILLION ECA being shared between contests and giveaways right now.

Anyone here interested in "Electra Classic" - or whatever its name might be...

Pre-Fork chain can still be synced, I get 64 peers if I do so, and all of them with wallet version 1.2. - so there might even be more people on the pre-fork chain than on
the actual one, block production still around 210 per day as before the fork.

So I'm wondering - did so many people miss the fork - or are they actually hoping to start a new project?

If anyone is reading this, who actually runs a pre-fork wallet - I'd be interested in a feedback...

If there is a project with the old chain, I am not aware of it.

As far as I know, Cryptobridge is the only exchange that did not update to the new wallet. So those in the old wallet actually HAVE an exchange which is more than we can say for the people still mining Coinye for the last 4 years.

And so - another month has passed from my last question, but the wallet works, and the weight of my coins does not increase, until now Weight is 9326913, unchanged .. and if you take the manual, then the number of coins * (multiply by days) .. What is wrong with me? or why the weight of my coins does not increase?

What make you think that if the mining will end the coin is a scam, there are always tx fees and also the code can be always changes, like it happened with DOGE.

The code already changed. The reward is about 2.5% annually instead of  50%

Max supply will not be reached for a long time.

And most importantly, it reduces sales pressure drastically. Controlled sales pressure is the key to a healthy price increase. Especially with the second part of the fork and Electrapay.

Restart your wallet first, usually it's enough to unblock the situation. I know there is a part of block which is longer to go through at the beginning of the chain
Be sure you are in the version V1.3, you should be on QT wallet. Go to HELP => About Electra

Delete your ECA folder in %appdata% and try again, sometimes (with many wallets) the sync process is getting stuck. Don't forget to backup your wallet.dat. Cheers!

having figured out how the bet works, I understand that with my 310k coins there is nothing to do in staking because for 2 months the expected remuneration is 11-18 days .. although earlier I received 2-3 times a month .. now and yes, considering that the maximum weight is reached for 30 days, it is almost impossible with the amount less than 1m

It is strange that such errors come out in such a large project. If understand correctly, then this is a problem in the code that needs to be fixed and not just a local error of the user's computer? Because this problem is common to many.

It happens if for example the computer reboot itself for an update (thanks windows) or a computer crash.

The daemon in these cases is not closed correctly, that's the reason. And in more specific cases with the upgrade to new blockchain (first time the upgrade is done)

If users have this error "regularly", best to use the QT wallet for now.  Both are the same in fact

ELECTRA SHELL EMPTY
It's been 1 month since I lost all my investment on ECA.
I've been supporting this piece for a year, because I was seduced by its community, which has since become considerably weaker
I have for those who do not know yet, lost more than 160 million ECA corners, from this moment I asked the support of the community, the founder, the ambassadors or the animators of the recent foundation but in vain.
All this will have resulted in me realizing that this piece takes the direction of a big shitcoin:
- Community at half-mast, in fact it is mainly composed of megalomaniacs who have invested nothing and only benefited from the super Rewards Bonanza and who dream of becoming a millionaire.
- A founder totally in darkness who with his pre-mine and staking related to it (1.5 billion pieces), aims to be a billionaire.
- A so-called foundation a big word for some people pushy, without any means and dependent on the possible generosity of a founder adventurer.
- No concrete project except the promise of a big partner imaginary or false for months, good intentions certainly with an electrapay, atomic swap .... that fantasies already existing on many other currencies.
- Some so-called partnerships without big interests that apart from ads or editing photos, not the slightest sign of conventions or contracts.
I totally assume my losses for which we will never be the reason or the mode, I dare to hope for a hacking even if nothing reveals, and not a conspiracy because yes I can be given a little easily my confidence to important members of the community.
This message has no purpose of revenge or anger, but only my feelings after a month of investigation.
My only regret is to have supported this project finally empty of solidarity, I will have to follow the few unique and real investors who have left the tub for a while !!

I am neutral on this issue. I will not intervene in the blockchain to support or block decisions made regarding this. Electra's blockchain is open source, and anyone can change it, but can only ensure their version becomes the main chain by achieving majority support. If a majority of users wish to intervene and fork to a version of the blockchain where this person had their assets, I won't stand in anyone's way.

To my knowledge, there is no way to know that the 160 million ECA by this person was transferred intentionally or stolen.

The personal attacks on me, the team, our community and Electra itself are unjustified and uncalled for as a lot of us have tried to help.

This person has stated to me that they shared their wallet info with others for help increasing their staking rewards. If you want to be safe, NEVER do this (even if it is me or someone from the team asking for it). This applies for every cryptocurrency, not just Electra.

99,999,999 ECA was sent from the pre-mine to the Electra foundation based in the Netherlands a few hours ago. 200,000,001 ECA further will be sent. I will be posting documents proving the existence of the foundation within a few days. I commend all the selfless pioneers who were involved in the creation of the foundation and wish them my best. Thanks to them we are, approximately, one of the rare 50 cryptocurrencies that have a foundation dedicated to them.

If you want Electra to remain competitive in the long-run, I urge you to support the foundation. The foundation is legally obliged to support and promote Electra and the more assistance you provide, the more you and all users will get back from it.

This payment was planned on this date for some time and not intended for appeasement regarding botero974.

- Furthering development of the Electra Project.

- Fostering community growth and community direction of the Electra Project.

- Working to increase the mass adoption of Electra, blockchain technology, and other cryptocurrencies in general through the collaboration of projects, companies, and partners.

Fake volume ON FATBTC
You Can actually see a couple days ago when they closed the bots
Without the bots FATBTC had 100dollars volume LOL
And its the number one volume contributor of the coin constantly

Unless they close the bots I suggest to keep away

It was useless to say it and it is a shame that you act under the effect of announcement
I think that if you wish good and enrich you on this piece it would be appropriate to play the transparency
But I will certainly impose on you in time, I'm here and I'll stay until I get what I want

ANNOUNCEMENT

I have been drafted by the military and will be completely unavailable for a month starting this Monday as there will be no phones or internet allowed where I'm going. This news was given to me 3 days ago, so I do not have much time to prepare.

Our social media, website, block explorers and foundation act independently of me so you can expect them all to be operational during my absence. Blockchain development is also expected to continue.

After one month, I expect to be back and will announce my return on Bitcointalk.

What do you suggest that the developers must do about the fake volume on FatBTC? They don't have any power to stop it, because they don't run the exchange, the only thing that the developers can do is to ask the exchange to delist ECA so the project to not be associated with them in any kind. But this (the fake volume) is a good and a bad thing, a good thing is that ECA have more visibility due to the exchange position and a bad thing at the same time, as you said, people will avoid a fake volume exchange, at least the big investors.

Well, the team could contact CMC and ask them to look in to the issue - because on FATBTC ALL volume is Fake, and this can easily be checked. So if CMC would do its Job properly, they would not list an obviously fake exchange with all fake volume, in all coins, not just ECA...

You think that fatbtc is the only exchange with fake volume and bots? Even the biggest top 10 exchanges have it.

Now today you can see the effects of the fake volume on the price
Cryptopia  has 5k real volume with its price at 7 shatoshi
FatBTC has 15k dominating the volume at 5 shatoshi driving the price down through FAKE VOLUME)
THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND REDICULOUS

Even though developers can't do anything about the fake volume above are the official chat channels of Electra you can have your voice heard over there.

There can't be any doubt that there is tons of fake volume and bots at work on all major exchanges. That is just how it is.

100% scam... I've been asking these questions and no one can answer them - even core members.

1. Why is e01 still staking? He has millions of ECA... WTF

2. Why is Ruru the only "dev" that's active? I've asked for the contacts of other devs but never get an answer... why? Because there are NONE or it's being outsourced. If the devs are being outsouced then here's the big issues.

- The outsourced devs are getting paid with ECA, who then dump it back on to their community - remember that big sell off? Makes sense
- or the devs are paid with BTC, but who is paying them? I don't see e01 paying or asking for community contributions... OH WAIT

They just asked for money because Ruru had to pay for some server bills... LOL there is an expense for running a business. This just shows that Electra cannot last longterm since they are going to keep asking for money or voluntary help. Flawed business model. Especially when e01 has MILLIONS of ECA unbelievable!

3. "MasterDen" keeps talking about new exchanges or partnerships. Over and over again. WTF - just pay for it and get listed! This is all bullshit because ECA is 100% voluntary, so where the hell would they get the money to pay for the exchanges? Exchanges all accept BTC so they are selling on their own community to get listed or are just lying to everyone.

ITS NOT HARD... PAY THE EXCHANGE THEN GET LISTED

No wonder it takes 6+ months for them to release something!

open up your eyes... and now e01 is on mandatory military leave? right before everything is supposed to be released? you have got to be kidding me



LightInOutDecember 05, 2018, 06:14:54 AM
There are no developers! Go into any project and you will see developers talking and giving updates to the community.

Electra only has Ruru?    unbelievable! Ask them for the contact or names of others. then also see how fast you get banned or they tell you to talk to Ruru.

I dont want to talk to Ruru!

They want to release atomic swaps, mobile wallets, electrapay and all this stuff in December but I can only talk to Ruru? what kind of a community project is this?

wake up people

gawleaDecember 05, 2018, 07:53:41 AM
I don't know if the project is now dormant or not, but I know that a couple of months earlier I have joined their Discord and I saw a lot of activity in there. Maybe they are working behind the scenes, as many core devs don't have time to talk to the community also, they have a Community Manager for this. Or maybe I am wrong and you are right I don't know what really happens inside the project, but the best thing to do is to join their Discord channel and talk to people in there about the development of the project and ask for any info that you are interested in.

All you are doing now, here, is to spread FUD and maybe the project doesn't deserve it.
Why the FUD is bad for a project when is moving slowly or the price is down? Well, because the investors will come in here and read about it, so with FUD you only can make things worst. Just my 2 cents..

Cheers G

December 05, 2018, 08:24:53 AM
I've asked Robert, Ruru, Aman and "MasterDen" to provide the contact info of other team developers, besides Ruru. They never give me an answer! their discord is full of people trying to get access to a rain room so they can collect eca then sell it for being active. 99% write stupid robotic comments and talk to themselves to remain active. Again, go look yourself. Nothing like it was months ago with a real community.

Ask the core team yourself and see what they say. I know plenty of devs in other projects that are at have a role on discord. They say they have a team or devs but are they not a part of the community?

Lastly their community project manager is Ruru? There was a tweet that said an Electra c++ dev finished something. Please tell us who that dev is cause I have a lot of questions for them. I've never seen any devs in discord or telegram. Don't give us the bs that they are too busy coding or don't have the time to talk. That will just show their priorities are not towards the community

It's not fud when it's true. Ask them yourself


LightInOutDecember 05, 2018, 08:42:46 AM
Look what happened to them this year

Ivan the lead dev left

Fork gets delayed

Absolutely nothing done or released until maybe December?

Something is happening behind the scenes and the core team is not being transparent with their investors or community.

They either have no developers ( another delay ), luckily found some volunteers ( why haven't we seen them interact with the community), or they finally started paying someone to fix this mess.

Here's the problems with the answers above

1. More delays

2. They found volunteers but they aren't active in the community. That goes against the project

3. They finally decided to outsource the work. Where is this money coming from? They can only have Electra or Bitcoin to pay for this. Either option involves hurting their own community.

They have to sell Electra for btc... or they pay the work in Electra and I'm sure that gets sold cause they want to get paid. Lots of stuff being released in December and lots of recent dumps. What a coincidence!!!

Ruru is asking for money to cover vps expenses. Why doesn't e01 pay for it? If he doesn't then they expect the community to cover everything?!

Now e01 goes off to military service? Big exit scam coming or announcements won't be what you all expect. The project isn't even sustainable if they have to keep outsourcing the work. Where is the money coming from?!

These are all questions investors should be asking themselves

It's not fud. Do your research and stop listening to what they keep telling you. Same story over and over again

IcathTradeDecember 05, 2018, 12:09:40 PM
@LightInOut

Putting so much energy into creating false information is wonderful, that's how the manipulation works. You expose false truths to frighten people and make the price drop in order to be able to fill our bags at lower costs. so classic...   

so! You said that Ruru is the only active dev? wrong.. oops! Ruru is the lead dev so she talk about the dev for the team. As Ivan earlier this year. same thing.

She works with another Dev on Electrapay. the first part is done and testing right now. For this test in real conditions, she had to setup a specific server via AWS. If you know AWS, you know it can be surprising in term of cost.

About the fork, E01 explained it clearly. He was in charge of it, had some problems finding a competent team. His error was to not communicate with the community team about that, agreed on this point.

Then a team member found a team of dev who accepted to make the fork with us. E01 handle the payment of the team on his own funds.  the first phase was released, and the second is currently in test. BTC core update, AS and others things...

If you are smart enough, you can see the fork progress on github. Still it is necessary to know how to use github....


About the recruitment announcement, it's for the next step of the project. I think you can understand that, the next release is not the end.... the project gains in technical growth and offers, therefore in human need to correctly carry out the whole project.

No need to be a scientist to understand that -_-


In summary there are actually 3 dev working on the current stuff, and a external team about blockchain stuff. (and it's only the ones I see myself, so it's not a restrictive number of course)

I understand you, it's easier to spread false information than doing serious research. And good idea to create an account especially to spread all your false stuff, it's very credible    


Sorry if my sentences are not perfect, it's not my original language




robertsebastianDecember 05, 2018, 12:38:25 PM
Hello anonymous person,

You sent me a twitter message from your anonymous twitter account past 24 hours wherein you asked for contact details of our devs.
You know crypto is all about anonymity, in fact you're operating anonymous where I chose to reveal my identity. ANd now you ask for the identity of devs that work on Electra. That sounds a bit strange doesn't it? IF people decide to stay anonymous we should respect that.

At this moment we work with internal as well as external devs to complete the work for Electra. In fact, as you may know from the past, E01 was responsible for the fork and still pays the cost related to hiring external devs working on phase 1 and phase 2 fork. This is all coordinated by Ruru.

Also what you should know is that we have the code in our private github (just like with phase 1) and when we're ready to go live with whatever we want to release, it get's pushed to the general github.

Eitherway, you have no right to claim to speak to the devs. They have more important things to do then defending themselves to someone accusing them and/or the project from false behavior or scamming.

Feel free to continue here or whereever, or conscience is clean and once the code is pushed into the github you'll see what work has been done.

Finally... yes... the past year was hard for us and some people left. In a matter of fact getting good devs is hard and dont even start about getting good devs willing to volunteer. Thats why we are gratefull and extremely happy Ruru is with us and coordinating both the internal as external devs as well as finishing ElectraPay herself.

Once E01 is back (he paid off military service and in his country it means you only have to serve 3 weeks) he will be able to respond to you but it wouldnt surprise me he doesnt find your comments worthy enough to spend energy on.
But about him dont forget he paid for exchange listings, he paid for dev work on the fork phase 1 and 2 and he already donated 100mln to the foundation where the remaining 200 mln come when he gets back.

You're not new in fudding or calling stuff fishy or related to exit scam and you certainly wont be the last.

robertsebastianDecember 05, 2018, 01:01:27 PM
@Everyone and @LightinOut

I'd like to close this topic through below message as i noticed that one of his tweets confirmed he is the same person as BOTERO on discord who claims to have lost 160mln ECA and holds the project responsible. https://twitter.com/lightinout/status/1070203781030268928


@lightInOut, also known as Botero on our Discord, claimed to have lost 160mln ECA without him being at fault. As such he contacted the team to compensate him either through forking the extra 160mln or ask E01 to compensate him.
As we always state in our disclaimers that we are never responsible for usage of our products and/or loss of ECA our answer could have been short but we took the time and investigated this matter together with this person. Our usersupport team and other team members spent hours and this matter was also discussing 3 times during our team meetings.

The end conclusion was that the wallet from this person was not flawed and it was visible that the transaction was made after insertion of the password.
See below the official response from the usersupport team on behalf of the project towards his claim to be compensated:

"Botero, after much testing and discussion, and over many discord sessions with you with a number of our team members, we regret to inform you that we are unable to reimburse you at this time for your coins. Reason stated below: the wallet is working has normal. Though, from your perspective this may not be true, the coins were sent and received in another address. This is normal function for a wallet. As to how those were transferred though, we can not confirm that as that is the case to any transaction. You stated that you have encrypted your wallet with very strong encryption. This alone would stop coins being sent only if the encryption password was used. Other way coins can be sent is if they have your private key, which a encryption password is not needed to add it to a wallet but is needed to dump from the wallet if the wallet is encrypted.
In our conversations with you and our team, we have noticed there was no bug or flaw in the wallet. In saying this, there is no way to prove if coins were sent wrongly out of the wallet by another user or yourself. ECA has one of the best tech support and these are the conclusions we have come up with. We are not here to guess if the coins were accidently sent to the incorrect wallet or if coins were sent correctly and the user does not have access to the new address. We also are fully aware of bugs that can be in the wallet though in your situation, is not the case due to the coins being sent and properly on the blockchain.

Thank you for your patience as we look and take each of these with dedication and want for all our users to have the coins they deserve. We did setup a channel just for you situation for us to discuss and you were brought up a number of times in team meetings with a number of hours for a number of support and dev personnel in trying to solve your unfortunate circumstance as you have shown.  We also understand that you may not agree with this conclusion and decision but these are the facts at hand. If you have any final questions, please feel free to ask but do note that this is our final decision. Thank you."


Everyone who still has questions can contact the usersupport team or myself on Discord. If people wish to help Botero / LightinOut by donating to him, I suggest to visit either Discord or contact him directly. Loosing crypto is something terrible and unfortunately happens regularly.

Best regards,
Robert



LightInOutDecember 05, 2018, 03:16:14 PM
There's a new thing called KYD - Know Your Developer

Apparently the Electra team does not want to tell us who their developers are.

I'm glad you at least admit that you're using EXTERNAL devs. Why did it take so many months for the team to finally hire someone? Can you give us their contact info or the name of the company you're using? No reason to be anonymous if they are a legit company. Investors should know who is working on the project.

I'm sure the Electra Foundation will have to disclose where money is spent? Let's start now. Or are we going to say e01 payments are different? Sometimes the foundation pays and sometimes e01 pays for anonymous stuff?

Electra is a community project, yet no one wants to volunteer. Do you all expect e01 to continue paying for everything? You already have Ruru asking the community for money to cover vps expenses. Why doesn't e01 cover her expenses?

Robert - You are the most honest and respected person on Electra team. Why do I now see you involved in so many different telegram projects? Also clearly investing in some of them. You used to be 100% Electra. Seeing you investing and being part of other groups makes people question your dedication.

How much Electra do you even own? I'm sure you will have to disclose this information if you're part of the foundation. Just like stocks of a company, the investors and public should know how many shares you have.



LightInOutDecember 05, 2018, 03:30:43 PM
There are 3 developers? Are they in discord or telegram? What are there names?

External team about blockchain stuff? What kind of stuff? I'm sure blockchain is basically the entire damn project. Do you know who this team is?

Why is Electra even hiring external people  to work on blockchain stuff? Those same people will work on other projects or are already doing it. Are you using freelancer website to find people?!?! How do we know quality of code? Team member can't check quality if they can't even code it - "looks good" LOL


IcathTradeDecember 05, 2018, 03:33:42 PM

It seems that you didn't do enough research.....


LightInOutDecember 05, 2018, 03:49:15 PM
Where? Robert says they are anonymous. That is the answer?

The Electra Foundation is hiring anonymous developers. So much for transparency and community efforts!

You apparently know who the 3 devs and external blockchain people are. Can you just tell us?

That would really give me and everyone reading this the answers to this topic

MorfusoDecember 05, 2018, 03:49:42 PM
It is very clear you know NOTHING about investment, foundation, Stock company or personal investment or whatsoever. And you just try to create FUD but this is old fashioned.  Everything you try to dig has been replied through social channels, engineering calls clearly.

So, please spend your time for better things.

Your transfers were investigated by the team where it is clear there is no bug inside the wallet. So remaining, are you trying to cheat the community ? You sold your coins or transferred your coins to someone and asking reimbusement ?  Do you think this is logic ?

MorfusoDecember 05, 2018, 03:51:50 PM
Crypto = Hiding ( in definition ) . If you don't know, go and learn. Secondly, the team is transparent even this is not a must under "cryptology" definition.

And once again. Electra is NOT a company. Electra was NOT an ICO. And it is been more then 1.5 years until today.

1. Please tell us how you see Electra partnering with DarkPay coin, an anonymous crypto project that doesn't even have a team page. Do you know who is on their team? I see you active in there and buying. Why not buy more Electra?

2. You are saying Electra is a currency not a company. But the foundation is a legal entity or company. You should discuss this with the other board members next week. Investors will want to know how much Electra Foundation board members have. I know I do!

3. Ruru needs money to cover vps expenses. You are asking the community to cover that with ECA. She needs money. This means the community will donate Eca to Ruru and she will go sell it on an exchange to liquidate it to pay for bills. The community donates to hurt their own price. PLEASE ANSWER WHY E01 DOESNT PAY HER?

4. I don't want the community to donate Electra to me. If they did then it would get sold back to them. This is a flawed project and will not last. You cannot continue paying for work by community donations

5. Will we see another post like below one day

Example 1
we want to get on another exchange. Please help us collect $50,000 in eca which we then sell back onto community because exchange wants btc

Example 2
There is a problem with atomic swaps. We need to hire dev for $10,000 to fix it. Please donate eca so we can have it fixed since no dev on team can do it

Your project devs and  e01 directly dumps on and hurts own community





LightInOutDecember 05, 2018, 04:57:09 PM
The Electra Foundation is a company and has a board of directors

Board of directors should disclose their holdings.

Why should I or anyone trust a company who has board members that do not disclose there interest?

At least we will know all of there names as THAT should be public.

MorfusoDecember 05, 2018, 05:05:58 PM
1- Electra is a community project
2- Electra Foundation is not a company ( go and educate yourself - read some information - make some research - check the Dutch law about foundation )
    Electra foundation board members are responsible against Dutch laws and the funds which are received to Official Foundation Account
    Electra foundation members are visible and not hiding themselves like YOU !!
3- If you can't realize the differences, nothing to say you further.


This crypto space really needs more educated and honest people for its future. Cleanup will hapen one day but it seems it will take more then expected !!

LightInOutDecember 05, 2018, 05:12:08 PM
The foundation is not a legal entity? Then what is the purpose of having board members? Just elected friends hanging out and talking about what to do with 300m eca premine? Which was not even received yet!

MorfusoDecember 05, 2018, 05:21:58 PM
Boy listen,

Foundation :
A foundation (also a charitable foundation) is a legal category of nonprofit organization that will typically either donate funds and support to other organizations, or provide the source of funding for its own charitable purposes.


Company :
A company, abbreviated as co., is a legal entity made up of an association of people, be they natural, legal, or a mixture of both, for carrying on a commercial or industrial enterprise



** I said "ELECTRA FOUNDATION is NOT a COMPANY" . Foundation / Company , both are fully different entities.

You don't read, you don't want to read, you have different intentions which is clear and we all know this. This is also my last message and can't waste my time to take you serious.

Good luck !!!


robertsebastianDecember 05, 2018, 05:23:18 PM


LightInOutDecember 05, 2018, 05:37:45 PM

Still waiting for the contact info of the 3 devs and external devs that are working on literally everything that's supposed to be released in December. Saying they are anonymous is not an answer.

If something goes wrong then the core team or Ruru is going to start asking for donations again to pay another dev to fix the issues. Who will then take that eca and sell it back onto the very same community that donated it

Will Ruru hold onto the eca donations sent to her for a specific time? Or will she sell it immediately? I'm sure the community would like an answer to that one. They can adjust their buy walls to help her sell off

It's great to see so many people join in on this discussion



RobofusDecember 05, 2018, 05:42:31 PM
if you are afraid that 800$ kill the project you can send here = you can contribute via PayPal here ruruelectra@gmail.com

LightInOutDecember 05, 2018, 05:55:00 PM
I'd rather watch everyone give their eca and watch her dump it back onto her own community

E01 should be giving her that little $800

That's just the start. Wait till more expenses show up


loweyboyDecember 05, 2018, 06:01:26 PM
I don't think I remember seeing on here, such a bitter person as LightInOut. Dude, it's time to drop it now, you are just making a fool of yourself, everyone can see what you are trying to do, it's not even subtle anymore, as at the start of this Thread where you at least tried to subtly lay down the fud, it was only a matter of time before you were outed as Botero and you speak about being transparent    Hypocrite.


LightInOutDecember 05, 2018, 06:15:02 PM
I don't need your donations or sympathy.

NONE OF YOU KNOW WHO THESE EXTERNAL DEVS ARE THAT ARE WORKING ON THE ELECTRA BLOCKCHAIN

I find this hilarious. Fork Phase 2 can have so many bugs and you will all have to continue donating to other devs to finish the project. It starts with $800 but let's see how long Ruru stays with Electra if that's truly a crazy expense for her. Guess time will tell!

RobofusDecember 05, 2018, 06:23:36 PM
you didn't  understand...
$ 800 represents only AWS rental charges (amazon server, shearch google :AWS) to run large programs such as electrapay. This does not pay developers who work voluntarily.

LightInOutDecember 05, 2018, 06:39:35 PM
Apparently The "external dev team" is being paid by e01

Ruru also has to pay for her expenses. This means her voluntary efforts are now costing her time AND money.

I'm starting to wonder if Ruru is 100% voluntary or if she's getting paid. She's been part of this project for over a year and is starting to ask for money. That's not a good sign


gawleaDecember 06, 2018, 08:34:58 AM
OK, first of all note that I am not holding any ECA (I had some in the past) so I am not holding their part nor I am paid for any comment by ECA team.

Second I want to apologies as I have not explained what FUD is; FUD = fear, uncertainty and doubt;

You fear that the project will fail because they delay the development, well... don't be! This is common in crypto, there are big project like Ethereum with a lot of developers and contributors which is delaying the switch from PoW to PoS for almost a  year now. Tezos have delayed the launch of the mainnet more than 6 months with 32 developers. Biggest project outside can't sometimes keep up with the development.

As for the ECA funding... well if they have sold half of the premine at, let's say, 20 sats they would have made 100 BTC so they have a lot of money for development.

What makes you think that the devs will give you their identity or contact info if their decision is to stay anonymous. This is crypto, in the end and the main reason that we all are here now, anonymity.


altfeederDecember 06, 2018, 11:21:48 AM
Based on the listing at Coindeal ( with our agreement) , there was a contest for top10 traders and prize distribution. Coindeal listing was free of charge based on a voting and we won it. Now, we must distribute the prizes to following ECA wallets from the foundation wallet:
1- ES6aETGvHeRbzhcnbpoJiQpndaMYVUMzQU  : 500000 ECA
2- EMy83p7NDqTVhaUDHVJsxyXzCGK4Zb2rye  : 250000 ECA
3- EJNMWtDUKqxjWdYJoFwMvec9Qdxy67mB9w  : 130000 ECA
4-
5- ELbG5KvYfcLFgYPjbgnCvLmtEZ5ZAeWEQc  :  26000 ECA
6- Ecg2PCe7Q5NKB8aFTTvF1sWT3Met1NZoYT  :  14000 ECA
7-
8-
9- EXPTBKYJrSnD1GnipwKXsbuX7hU7aqjDbF  :   3000 ECA
10 - Ec292t3QuVfm1aFwJVKMR9eKeUXJB9a5hq  :   2000 ECA

4th,7th and 8th places still need to send their ECA wallet addresses. Once they provide their wallet addresses, payments will be as below :
4- 60000 ECA  // 7- 10000 ECA  // 8- 5000 ECA

LightInOutDecember 06, 2018, 05:18:09 PM
Electra is supposed to be a community project. Robert keep saying they have all these teams but there are no active devs in telegram or discord, just Ruru. You can be anonymous but at least engage with the community.

Now he is saying they have external devs working on the blockchain. Guess Electra isn't a community project anymore! Why? No one wants to volunteer for this project. Look at Ruru requesting money. This project won't last if they need to keep paying people and expenses. There was no ico and the bonanza people don't care. Or people donate eca which is then sold onto the community for btc funding - ouch!!!

Why won't robert make a tweet saying their team is all external and paid for? Instead he makes it look like they are part of this community project. That is not transparent

Look  at Cryptopia distribution chart. You have 3 huge and recent bag holders. Just wait for them to dump on all of you

In our project the developers are close to the community, easy to reach out to and take the time to explain their views in videos like this



They are so easy to reach out to. Can you please give us their contact info? All I keep seeing is Ruru   

I'd like to talk to a dev other than Ruru

Now everything is external and anonymous

But all devs are close to the community and easy to reach out to!

JUST CANT TALK TO THE DEVS E01 HAS HIRED TO WORK ON PHASE 2 OF THE FORK - the most important part of the project

LOL what a joke


loweyboyDecember 06, 2018, 06:40:38 PM
ou shouldn't guess LightInOut, that's what probably got you into this mess in the first place, and in any case why are you so worried, you sold/transferred all your ECA and then tried to scam the team, and got caught out. I don't really see any point you keeping up with the charade as everyone already knows the truth.

LightInOutDecember 06, 2018, 07:39:17 PM

happy with the project the concept is good and which gives good pos


LightInOutDecember 06, 2018, 09:23:37 PM
he concept of hiring anonymous devs for a community project is good?

going from 50% to 2% pos staking is good?

you are all brainwashed or was this a paid shill post?

RobofusDecember 07, 2018, 09:00:17 AM
ok you want FUD because you hate to have lost your money,
but how do you explain staying on Electra with a 2.5% POS? (before your loss)

and then say
"going from 50% to 2% pos staking is good?"




LightInOutDecember 07, 2018, 05:00:48 PM
Going from 50% to 2% is crap. Your anonymous e01 couldn't edit a few lines of code in the blockchain.

Could have changed the percentage months before "phase 1" but he killed the total supply

Lots of whales bought in for masternodes but now it's impossible to implement them

This project is not meant to survive long term

Poor Ruru is giving all her time AND paying to help electra. How much eca does she have? Unless she has 100m+ then she will give up soon as it's not worth it. Keep asking your community to invest and pay for devs or expenses


RobofusDecember 07, 2018, 07:12:42 PM
you are no longer credible ...

You don't answer :
Why did you keep your Electra before your loss (at 2.5% of stake and not 2%)
and now you criticize that

LightInOutDecember 07, 2018, 10:35:56 PM
credible for what?


1. e01 is anonymous

2. partnerships are delayed for months. if they even exist

3. exchanges are delayed. remember MasterDen saying 10+ exchanges and all that bs in early 2018?

4. fork delay all when e01 just had to edit the percentage in code!!! IDIOTS

5. entire project has total supply issues

6. electra has no funding. devs are asking community for donations. why e01 not pay it?

7. what does mobile wallet have to do with fork delay? just excuse. same with other delays

8. you have active devs that are easy to reach out to but NOT the ones e01 has hired. no transparency or trust

9. all core members have blocked me on twitter, i can still view accounts by logging out   

10. already saying q1 2019 for things that were supposed to be in december



electra project has a team that hides information from their community

ivan clearly messed up the wallet and you STILL RELEASED IT.

knowing that there were issues


RobofusDecember 07, 2018, 10:48:17 PM

Dear Electra community. We are pleased to inform you about our project https://elechats.top which logs all important telegram chats related to Electra. We believe that Electra Chats will be a valuable addition to the Electra ecosystem. During the work of the site, we have already received a large number of positive feedback from community members. The project is under active development. The project has its own team of programmers, ready at any time to solve new technical problems and make new improvements.

What is implemented at the moment:
You can read your favorite sites in a convenient form for you through https://elechats.top
The site is optimized for work and on mobile devices. There is a search by keyword and date. It is possible to read the chat you want in your native language using Google Translate.

Developers Electra relaxed a bit and do not show the proper result. I do not know what it is connected with, we hope that the developers will more actively communicate with their community.

botero974December 11, 2018, 12:13:55 PM
After reading the last pages since my speech on November 19th, thank you to those and especially to Super Robert for having assimilated me to LightInOut.
However, I thank Lightinout for having built much better than me the hidden scam that is ECA
However, I do not need to hide behind another nickname to warn potential investors or rather future victims.
Yes it was necessary that members of the community steal my wallet and it is well to remind him, to realize the trickery that is this "project"
Useless here to recall the fundamentals that do not exist, Lightinout does it better than me
Flee is my only advice !!


botero974December 11, 2018, 12:51:46 PM
It is very surprising to note that on the tweet of lightoutin who also claims to have lost 160 million pieces, my lord Robert answered immediately by 4 times ?? Except me it was necessary to revive several times to finally answer 15 days after  
I am not the first person to have lost his pieces on this "project" what is it of the others? bring your testimonials that this scam stops
I also suspect that Master Den, E01 and company are the same person !! who is hiding behind this masquerade ??

LightInOutDecember 11, 2018, 02:55:48 PM

None of them do any research into their own project. They just repeat the same stuff over and over again.

How many knew that the anonymous E01 has hired anonymous devs to work on the next fork?

but they all say their devs are easy to reach out to and talk with the community LOL

Also why do you reply to your old account ?  Huh

That things are clear, I do not know who is this lightinout, has he also lost his wallet, I do not know, certainly if he insists so!
I do not need to take refuge behind another nickname to express myself, botero974 is easy to identify because I use it everywhere.
all these barren debates of who is not interested in me, what I know is that my pieces have been stolen and I am sure that it was committed by a member of the community.
since this loss I have inevitably asked myself a lot and realized after my investigations, that this project is full of uncertainties and managed by incompetent dreamers.
Free to everyone to continue or invest in this deceit
I blindly carried this project for 1 year and today I have to denounce the scam and I would do it for a long time

This is the type of people defending Electra... You dont even know who I am but you keep asking personal questions. idiot

this is the 100+ time I have asked for you and core members to tell us all who these easy to reach and community developers are?

it looks like electra has a core team that does not tell their community what they are truly doing. and they dont know what is happening because there is a SECOND team that is made up of developers that only e01 has access to since they are all anonymous.


you get angry that i dont answer your question because you dont even know what your own project is doing

LightInOutDecember 15, 2018, 08:31:39 PM
im sure you have more than 12m eca now. i am also sure you got all of that at 1 sat or less so you can sell at a profit

judging by your post history and French messages i bet you have also spoken with Ivan and the french eca community that constantly dumped on everyone

keep asking stupid personal questions but dont answer questions about the project you supposedly support

LightInOutDecember 15, 2018, 11:00:15 PM
"Electra you can rest assured that our developers have the highest credentials, utmost integrity and have had their identities verified for the good of the project and community"

Wow Cpollo verified who E01 is and all the anonymous developers that he hired?

What a joke. Cpollo just lost all their credibility by issuing this certification 😅

I will message them to ask for info... let's see what they say


LightInOutDecember 15, 2018, 11:56:53 PM
ou can't make this stuff up!


1. I looked at the CPOLLO white paper and it says - "All team members must submit to a Know Your Developer (KYD) process that includes: Identity verificatio n, residency verification, and skill verification."

Robert wrote - "They choose to be anonymous. Just like yourself, E01 and many others in crypto"

How did CPOLLO verify the anonymous E01 and external devs working on Electra? Robert doesn't even know who they are!!! LOL





2. I asked Robert - "How much Electra do you even own?" and he said "This is not a respectful question and also not relevant" and all you shillers said ECA is not a company and blah blah blah.

To get CPOLLO certification they say - "require members to provide their wallet addresses"

Was that not respectful and relevant to CPOLLO but not your own community?



-----


As per their certification, CPOLLO must know the identity of E01, all anonymous devs working on the project and their personal wallet addresses.


IF THIS IS TRUE.... why not share the same information with your community? Are you not a community project?


WHY DOES CPOLLO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION BUT NOT YOUR INVESTORS?



lance001December 16, 2018, 12:53:57 PM
Again you are misreading too much things......
They ask the team to provide payment wallets and not personal wallets. as stated here: (from their registration form)
You looked at the wrong section. You were looking at the part for projects that want to launch an ico on their platform.

Look at section 6.3: "Cpollo Approved" Project Vetting

The vetting process is similar to all projects applying to the Cpollo platform with more comprehensive additions. The vetting process involves the following but is not limited to:

All team members must submit to a Know Your Developer (KYD) process that includes:
o Identity verification, residency verification, and skill verification Projects must submit the following documents:

Plus

o One-page project overview
o Whitepaper
o Certificate of Incorporation
o List of coin or token allocation including addresses of all development
wallets and team pay wallets

 --  --  --  -- 

So Electra team told Cpollo who e01 is or at least the external and anonymous devs that Robert said they hired?

Team pay wallets... to me that's personal wallets of the core team. Perhaps they should word it differently

I find it hilarious that you all continue to argue with me when you don't even know who your developers are or how much eca the core team owns

Electra Receives CPOLLO Seal of Approval

Recently Electra earned the prestigious CPOLLO seal of approval from the industry's most rigorous critic. CPOLLO's goal is to ensure that only the best blockchain projects with known developers, verifiable technology and project documents including a roadmap and whitepaper receive their coveted approval.

germsiteDecember 19, 2018, 05:35:08 AM
And what is it that puts CPOLLO into a position to decide which project is strong and which is not?


altfeederDecember 21, 2018, 04:08:07 PM
Attention Electra Community -

yesterday round 13:30 GMT+1, 9111460.00 ECA has been transferred from the Foundation wallet address.

These funds have been moved as compensation to a community member due to a bug in the "Desktop Wallet", this bug was active in May during the Desktop Wallet's initial release. This bug was "fixed immediately in few hours" after it was detected.

The bug essentially was that when transferring ECA to another wallet address the total amount would be used as a fee. Following the detection and correction of this bug, there were several announcements to our community announcing a mandatory wallet update to address the issue.

Our community and its members are always trying to improve the ecosystem of the Electra Project and provide user-friendly tools and systems. Following this incident, our support team learned an important lesson and started testing newly developed tools multiple times before release. With this in mind, we still believe that this is still not enough. We kindly ask community members to do their own tests with smaller amounts whenever they download and start using newly released software and tools.

If you have any questions about this case, please contact our user support, or me personally on telegram (@BobvanE).

TLDR : This is a one-time reimbursement to a community member due to a  bug in the desktop wallet.

This year the staking percentages are 2.5% annually.

The whitepaper will be updated soon as well as the roadmap,...

Also you'll have to keep a look to the announcements in the next days to update the wallet for the upcoming hard fork

Can someone from the Electra team explain the Agile Legal partnership?

Did you just pay them a retainer fee and now they are a partner?    or did the firm receive or invest in ECA for equity?

or is this all pro bono?

I'm sure it's just another BS vaporware partnership that they are trying to promote. The only thing they've released all year was a half ass wallet that is filled with bugs.  Now E01 is called out to "military" draft yet the foundation still only as 1/3rd of the funds.  Mark my words, E01 isn't coming back anytime soon. If CPOLLO is legit and knows who E01 is, then the team should release this info to investors.


cryt0_l0rd
December 24, 2018, 05:04:00 AM
Verification doesn't mean verifying each and every member it means verifying the core team members which are MasterDen, Robert, Bob to name some and even if E01 submitted his documents for KYC he decided to stay anonymous and that's not a big issue as crypto is not the only think he is dealing with he might have professional life bcoz of which he can't disclose his identity presently.

And regarding your stupid claim for why robert not showing his wallet address? My question is why he should show his personal wallet address which he brought from his own money the community should be interested in premined addresses and foundation address which they have made available publicly

Why should we interfere into someone's personal investment when the project is not an ICO where team members got millions for free.

Thank you.


cryt0_l0rd
December 24, 2018, 05:10:32 AM
Cpollo doesn't said anywhere that their approval means a project is strong it just means that the core team members have:

- Provided the KYC documents
- Mentioned wallet address (for electra it's premined address as it's not an ICO where team members got huge bag for free.


cryt0_l0rd
December 24, 2018, 05:28:46 AM	 #2904


They have told so many times in Engineering call that company will come only after ElectraPay is released and the discussion started because of contact of one of the community member so once ElectraPay is released the discussion will enter the final phase.

From December 2017 to December 2018 they have released:

- From 1 exchange to 7 exchange
- Desktop wallet
- Partnerships with Unifox, Investaco, General Bytes and one more coming soon. (Unifox already started deployment of ATMs and Investaco already into final beta testing of Debit cards)
- Established Foundation
- In 2019 it will be added on Hardware Wallet.
- The phase 2 fork will have Atomic swaps, Bitcoin core upgrade and POS protocol upgrade check github for the code. And after fork the ElectraPay will be released.

And this are things they did and I guess it's good for a 1 year project to achieve all this with help of only community members

If he had to run away he would have done it during the bull run when volume was more than 500+ BTC on daily basis than now when the price is also down and volume too. So this is BS imo
Cpollo as well exchanges like coinbene all know E01 as he submitted his documents for KYC of founders but the exchange have policy to respect the choice of people and they won't disclose it publicly documents like this just because few anonymous people asking someone to reveal identity when they themselves have decided to hide their own identity.

December 24, 2018, 02:41:42 PM	 #2907

 
I think you are just being blinded by the BS the team feeds you.

Ask yourself if this sounds like a strong project and a good investment:

-Roadmap months behind.

-E01 no longer developing. Ruru had to take control of the fork as it was never going to get done.

-Team had to beg/threaten him to stop staking so they could finish phase 1 of the fork before max supply was reached.

- Due to the screwed up supply from E01 staking millions of coins, masternodes will never happen and staking had to be reduced to an amount that is not worth holding the coin.

- The primary dev lost her job from working on ECA and the team bought her a laptop just so the project wouldn't completely die.

- Most of original core team has left.

- Desktop wallet filled with bugs.

- 300 mill in foundation funds? What do you think that will do? That's not even enough to pay a listing fee on an exchange.

- Asking developers to work for free because they have no money to pay.

The list goes on and on. ECA is a failed project and will likely eventually die. I'm sorry but I'm being honest. Don't just blindly believe the crap they tell you on the calls. There is a lot that investors don't know.


cryt0_l0rd
December 24, 2018, 06:59:46 PM
 Only Masternode is something which is not coming from Roadmap of 2018 rest all will be released after the fork one by one (There will be announcement for fork block number within next few days)

- E01 was never a main developer since the community had taken over. The lead developer since the start is Ruru and E01 only looks after the blockchain security and some other details related to blockchain.

- Ruru is the person since Day 1 working on fork as lead developer you need to listen to calls where she herself explained what she is working on

- If you know how to check codes just visit the Github and see you will find all MasterNodes code present in Fork 2 but won't be activated as for you MN is an profit machine but in technical terms MN is for better security and health of blockchain and fortunately ECA have good blockchain and with upcoming ATMs and POS Machine roll out in 2019 by Unifox and Investaco + ElectraPay for Merchants we will have enough nodes running for keeping the blockchain healthy.

- Yes Ruru lost her Job because she was working with a Bank on a top position and then side by side she is working on crypto project whose primary aim is to shut down banks so I guess you are matured enough to understand the conflict of interest here and reason why her bank removed her.

- Most original core team left? lol seriously? MasterDen, Aman, Robert, Bob, Tekin, Asmoth, Ruru, Jenova, Lane, Nashlay, Studly, Cryptonaut all are since December 2017 and still present.

The ones who left were the products of bull run just name the person and you will find they joined after February

- Desktop wallet filled with bugs? I have an iPhone and trust me even after being a trillion dollar company they have bugs in their product and to fix it they regularly release updates almost every alternate month so I guess ECA is good enough as all the funds are secured and the bugs are UI related and not technical ones.

- 300 Million for foundation right now might not be a huge amount but right now they don't even need to use those money for anything so why to worry about it now.

- Asking developers to work for free? I was not knowing that bitcoin pays it's developers for working on bitcoin blockchain.

A community project with NO ICO and premined which is 3.34% of total circulation cannot pay each and everyone and those who have joined know the fact and even then they work on it for almost a year with same passion so why you are worried about it when you are not even working.

The answer goes on. ECA has proved all such fudders wrong and it will do it in future as well. With each passing month the community is only getting stronger and stronger and I am sorry but I'm being honest here. I don't just blindly believe the crap you tell on the BCT. There is a lot that you don't know.

they had to hire an external dev company to complete the next fork. Robert even said that. That's why it's funny for Cpollo to verify them. They said it themselves in their telegram group. They didn't verify anyone because it's a "community project" and everyone is on the website.

I didn't know that KYD means you can just look at the team section and say - Yup, looks legit!


You can argue all you want but:

You don't know who the Electra developers are

You don't know how much the core team holds

Your 300m premine wont last a few months, if used for exchanges or salary

You can't expect people to devote their life to a project when it doesn't pay them or their bills. Unless some got in below 1 sat and are able to pay bills by selling their ECA.

Everyone says Electra is a community project but has a core set of people making all the decisions. There's no open voting or anything to get the community involved with decisions on partnerships or exchange options. You have no choice but to accept what they choose to do for you

I want to know the core team members wallet addresses, especially if they are part of the foundation. How do we know if they are selling or buying before a big announcement?

They keep saying how transparent they are but I don't see that. I don't see the transparency in hiring external anonymous devs and not telling the community. It's deceiving to say Ruru is doing the development when she is not. It looks like it on github because she's uploading their work


cryt0_l0rd
December 25, 2018, 05:33:25 PM	 #2910


- External devs are not full-time developers that need to reveal their identity they come work and go. And verification again doesn't mean each and every person it means of selected core team only which they did.

- Do you know the developers of BTC or XRP or LTC or ADA or ETH? You know because they have mentioned on their website and the same way the team page shows Electra Team as well.

- Why we should even know how much core team holds that's their personal holding and not taken from premined or got it for free. We should know about premine and that details they have provided.

- ECA already told that they won't be paying the huge bags to get listed on exchanges and the majority work for free as volunteers so salary is only for things when hired on external basis but that's not a huge amount as it's work based.

- No one is saying to denote the whole life it's the beauty of community project one goes someone else takes his place. You think in BTC people who were in 2010 are still working.

- Even a normal community member can talk and get a partnership till now everything is done by community members and all are partnerships be it Unifox, General Bytes, Investaco or any other are with help of community members ( which include core team as well) and without any payment for partnerships

- Want to know core team wallet address? So they don't sell/buy before big announcement? I guess all the other 2000 crypto projects team members have made their wallet address public and ECA is the 1st team which is not doing it right LOL

- Why do you want to know anonymous dev? Do you know all the team members of other projects personally? Ruru is a lead developer just backtrack those commits you will find other developers as well and the final commit comes from the lead developer who is RURU


Listen Botero974 aka lightinout aka Dan Dijoux you tried hard to scam and get 161 Million ECA and you failed so you created multiple fake accounts and started FUDDING and your twitter is blocked already as you used bots so it's useless as we have seen lots of scammers like you in past and the common result was all of them failed in scamming ECA.

Listen Botero974 aka lightinout aka Dan Dijoux you tried hard to scam and get 161 Million ECA and you failed so you created multiple fake accounts and started FUDDING and your twitter is blocked already as you used bots so it's useless as we have seen lots of scammers like you in past and the common result was all of them failed in scamming ECA.


oh, thank you for all these attributes, as found it is not difficult to find me as I said, I do not need to hide behind several nicknames or false accounts ... why ??
I had almost accepted to have been stolen my coins, but your insult to want to attribute to me all the accounts coming here to denounce this scam obliges me to intervene


Above it is clearly demonstrate that this piece is soulless, needless to repeat all the flaws (lack of developers, phony foundation, no transparency, zero support .... the list is still long.
YES Dan DIJOUX (aka botero974) it's me and I encourage you to flee this shit and YES I keep saying it can only be a member of the community who stole it from me or a flaw but who benefits inevitably to a member ....
There are so many other more holy projects !!

The fact that you think Ruru has been the main dev all along proves you really don't know what transpired. I have screenshots of conversations If proof is needed. Ruru had to take control before max supply was reached. The code was so screwed up she had to work nonstop through the night for days on end just to release 1/2 of the fork.  Without her, the project would have went to zero.

And you guys have to stop comparing yourselves to Bitcoin. Yes, BTC developers are not paid. ECA is not Bitcoin and will never be Bitcoin. People lose interest when they are not compensated for their efforts.

Also this nonsense about how mass adoption will keep the blockchain healthy. Out of all the cryptocurrencies, none have been able to achieve mass adoption, but ECA will? You honestly think people are going to go to an ATM to do an ECA transaction and merchants will be flooded with ECA payments? No. The coin supply is ruined due to 50% staking and E01 staking millions.  That's why masternodes are not possible and staking is so low it's not worth holding the coin.

I hear all the time, "If E01 was a scammer he would have sold at the top."  Bullshit. Nobody knew where the top was and that's why people are stuck holding bags. He, like everyone else last year thought the price would keep going up. So I don't think that's a good excuse.

This isn't FUD and it isn't trolling. It's the truth and all ECA does is cover up the truth and string people along so the price doesn't crash to zero.  ECA doesnt let anyone ask questions without being called a "Fudder" or negative. That's a major red flag.

Your points are the feigned outrage. There's so little there compared to almost any other project. Yet here you are, day after day fudding. I hope investors read each page too, to see what you avoid, (documented) and what you answer (i.e. nothing) The answers you desire are your own, 95% of us think you're a tool with a vendetta. Every project has its own oddities. Every project has it's own Fud Bots that are like you. ECA has always worked on schedule for me, and my wallet has always worked flawlessly. (I've been here since before they even had a website) - so I have watched every step of progress and am committed for the long haul. Go Away. You hate the project, get off your own  made up pedestal.

I promised to put an end to this scam and end up digesting my loss.
Finally having carried this project for a long time and encouraged some to invest in it, I must denounce the dubious practices of the members of this "community"
I have, as you already know, lost my entire portfolio of 161 million pieces.
At the beginning of this adventure a year ago, I had all confidence and especially for lack of competence, let a certain Aykut Baybas allias Masterden (N ° 2 of the project) to intervene and take remote access on my wallet to insert the configuration file under MAC.
In view of the reputation of this person after my last investigations notament in EagleCoin, would he take advantage of this moment to steal my .dat file and thereafter steal my pieces ??
I obviously have proof of what I'm saying, through message exchanges between him and me.
I have a long time after this mishap tried to find a solution with the management team but without success, except that of me banned networks Discord, Telegram ....
I wonder if E01, Masterden, Robert ... and maybe another French-speaking network are not complicit.
It's decided, you can count on me to devote the necessary time to denounce this scam, you have my word.
Small important point, a scammer who could have hacker my computer to steal my pieces as it was often mentioned, would have had much better to take than my ECA portfolio or then would not be satisfied that ECA 😉
Take me as a troll and whatever you want, give me all the accounts that come here denounce this scam but the sad truth is that they stole my wallet and I do not need to hide myself to denounce these bandits

You would be up even more if you had sold your ECA before Ivan (a core team member at the time) and all the French members agreed to sell

They all had access to core info and sold onto the community. I mean they "left" because they didnt want to volunteer anymore

Engineering Call #17: January 2nd, 2019

Special Thanks to ECA Vagabond from Discord for writing the summary of Engineering Call.


Fork Phase Fork 2:
-development has been finished for a bit now, since the last call the team has been busy testing
-changes are pushed thru on Ruru's GitHub
-Atomic Swap testing is very close, one small bug to overcome. Ruru says testing could be complete within hours/days
-Hard Fork block # is picked, will be finalized and announced within a couple of days


ElectraPay:
-testing is going well
-coming in January


New QT Wallet Update:
-coming in January
-QT will be released first; Desktop Wallet needs a bit more work before it is good to go on the new blockchain


Website:
-new website is "live"!!
-more updates to be rolled out with the fork + in January
Thanks to all who contributed


Marketing/Partnerships:
-new partnership contract to be finalized today or tomorrow
-no real update here...as usual, the team is working hard to secure more partnerships at all times


Exchanges:
-no real update here either...team is still in the process of shifting focus to bigger, more meaningful exchanges


Foundation:
-EO1 is back from the military, 200mln deposit will be coming soon
(for now, the fork is taking priority)


Misc:
-Debit Card Design contest is still live! Get your designs in ASAP

The biggest mistake a cryptocurrency investor can make is to invest in a project that has neither purpose nor real demand ...
Ask yourself the right questions, what are you waiting for this piece ??
For a long time I bet on his community, on his roadmap, on announcements to finally realize me that it is managed by crooks and that nothing which was programmed has emerged:
- Atomic swap
- Mobile Apps
- Electrapay
- Partners with more than 30 billion ...
The team has been dissolved for a year and the best have left the titanic !!
I do not provide investment advice on investments in digital assets; However, I strongly suggest you do your research on this project and learn about the problems encountered in the past year.

Electra is still a partner with Linda?

I visited mynodepool.com and don't see Electra listed there.


cryt0_l0rdJanuary 12, 2019, 02:44:55 AM
Yes that is because ECA never partnered for mynodepool.com as mynodepool is staking pool.

And ECA partnered with linda for Mobile Wallet for Linda which you can find here https://www.mystakingwallet.com/

The one you mentioned asked people to send coins for staking so private key is with 3rd party.

And the one it has partnered with is one which you have private key with you and you manage your funds.

It is clear that you wont be a developer since you had to hire external and anonymous team to complete this next fork

I also find it interesting you needed a developer to integrate ECA into the KOMODO platform.

Lots of projects are using KOMODO for atomic swaps. Why was it so easy for them to do it?

	



Electra01

January 23, 2019, 01:39:09 AM	 #2954

 
Dear Stakeholders,

31,500,000 ECA has been transferred from the pre-mine in order to pay for development obligations involving the upcoming fork.




Electra01January 23, 2019, 02:37:58 AM
I answer your first question in an interview I gave a few months ago:
https://medium.com/@crypTogether/by-dre-499704674e5f

I do not find it irregular to work with additional developers. The project has grown too much to be solely developed by myself. If they wish to be anonymous I will respect their wishes. The important thing is that the code is open source and reviewable by anyone.

We were missing some of the required code for integration with Komodo/Barterdex. This has obviously been solved for the upcoming fork as we have successfully completed Atomic Swaps with Komodo.


LightInOutJanuary 23, 2019, 05:04:01 AM
Will Electra have the ability to do Atomic Swaps without Komodo in the next fork?


There's over 100+ projects that have Atomic Swaps with Komodo/Barterdex


 https://docs.komodoplatform.com/barterDEX/list-of-all-coins-tradable.html


How long did it take the additional developers to connect ECA with Komodo?



AltInvestor2018January 28, 2019, 03:08:21 PM

Will this amount be deducted from the 200m that's scheduled to be transferred to the Foundation this week?
On the Foundation...I was under the impression they would be providing some kind of accounting for the funds.  To date,  they've already spent about 14,000,000, or approx 13% of their initial funds (100m from you,  5m from donation wallet),  with no accounting for it, at least not publicly as they'd claimed. 
They also said they'd be posting minutes from their meetings,  which they've also failed to do. 
This lack of transparency or accountibility is really concerning. They've been set up for over 3 months now, so the excuse that it's "new" I don't think is valid anymore.
I think you should reconsider sending any additional funds to the Foundation until such time as they can account for their spending and supply meeting minutes. 
By all accounts,  you are more transparent than the Foundation,  and the premine would be better off in your hands. 


AltInvestor2018January 29, 2019, 04:10:07 AM
I just saw on Discord that Robert claims the Foundation hasn't spent 14 million... Which means he doesn't know what's going on,  or its something he doesn't want known.  This brings up another question of who exactly has access to the funds and who authorizes or keeps track? If Robert himself doesn't have a clue,  the options are
A) they have no real foundation control and it's all a front for someone else actually controlling the funds,
B) they're unprofessional, disorganized, & haven't been keeping track,  or
C) they've transferred funds secretly and gotten caught
I can't think of one good,  valid reason why Robert himself wouldn't know how much has been spent. 


Electra01January 29, 2019, 05:19:13 AM
the 31.5 million will not be deducted.

The foundation statutes state that financial reports will be provided within two months of the end of the fiscal year (in their case December 31).

My team has asked me to share the image below with you. It is still in development but should provide the transparency you are looking for when released.

robertsebastianJanuary 29, 2019, 06:35:25 PM

For your information, the komodo developers don't code the atomic swap of other projects/coins. Just final test and integration once the project's devs have finished.

And as you have already been answered, developers don't need to be public..... As on Bitcoin or more recently on Grin..........

You can check their commits on the github when Ruanne published it and validate. -> https://twitter.com/ECA_Ruru

Can you tell me what you're looking for by wasting your time attacking Electra?


PS: concerning the 31M it's about E01 not the foundation...

 you should come  "Discord" if you have so many questions or write in single message (without double post) which mixes all the discussion.

January 29, 2019, 06:49:08 PM
Thank you for your professional,  non-condescending answer.  I don't ask these questions to create FUD, as Robert has implied in his response,  but out of a real sense of concern for the management and direction of the project.  
Dec 6th on the explorer shows 5.4m transferred out which is unaccounted for on the sheet the team provided you with?
My other big concern is that the Foundation Board doesn't have the time available to commit  to the project.  As volunteers,  their time is definitely appreciated,  however it would appear the Project could be being held back due to their inability to commit more time.  It's very worrisome that the responses for why things aren't done always contain a disclaimer that falls along the lines of "we're volunteers,  appreciate what you get,  we don't have time".
Is there no way that the current Foundation members could assign rights or powers to people such as Master Den and Asmoth who are available more?
Last question... it has been discussed frequently in the past that a way for the community to have more input and voting powers would be implemented, but so far it just seems to be becoming more and more restrictive and exclusive to an extremely small handful of people. Has the idea of a "community run" coin & community voting rights been abandoned? Just as a for instance... the decision to use foundation funds to fund Aircoins is questionable at best IMO. Much more effective forms of advertising they could be paying for.  
Thank you again for your professionalism and cooperation.

Does Aircoins provide analytics as to how many of their users receive ECA airdrops via their app?

Will Electra foundation be responsible for maintaining this partnership? or will members be required to donate ECA to Aircoins?

I would like to know what the ROI is of this partnership!

	




AltInvestor2018
Robert,  I have always held you in high regards, however your condescending attitude towards anyone who dares to ask a question is exactly why I chose to post my questions anonymously in here instead of in Discord, where I'll be ostracized for daring to question anything. I'm in there daily,  and see how everyone's treated if they're not cheerleading.  I am indeed grateful for all the volunteers,  however being a volunteer doesn't mean you're above reproach or not accountable. 
I ask these questions out of concern for the project. It's called diligence,  not FUD.
You yourself claimed in the past in Discord that meeting minutes and accounting would be available once the website  was live.  It's now live,  and still nothing is available.  As you've intimated,  almost all answers are available if one looks hard enough... except for anything related to the Foundation.  It would take 5 minutes to post minutes in Discord.  30 seconds to post big expenses. Since the Foundation was formed in October,  I don't think it's at all unreasonable to expect some kind of progress report, minutes,  or accounting,  even if the volunteers are all part time.

It's been 5 months since I posted any questions,  at which time I thanked you for your answers and professionalism.
That's obviously changed based on the aggressive responses you're giving this time. If answering my questions takes 30% of your time,  it just demonstrates how little time you actually have to commit to the project.
Calling for people on Discord to,  and I quote you "Suffocate fudders with love and respect." in order to bury valid concerns and questions about funds being moved from the wallet and lack of transparency from the Foundation is literally getting the community to pull the wool over their own eyes. 
You've said s couple of times now that the expenses are posted on bitcointalk.  E01's, yes.  Consistently and timely.  The Foundation's, no.  Not until E01 posted the spreadsheet AFTER  I asked why 13% of the funds had already been spent with no accounting.  The very question that got any kind of accounting from the Foundation posted on bitcointalk you dismiss as FUD. (You have an inaccuracy Dec 6 by the way... There's an additional 5.4 million that was sent out that's unaccounted for). You yourself denied on Discord yesterday that over 14m has already been spent,  which means YOU didn't even know until I asked. 
You are literally making false accusations and talking in circles in the hopes of diverting the community's attention away from the real issues,  concerns,  and questions.
Answering questions in a direct,  factual manner as E01 does in far more professional,  and will result in far less replies from concerned community members trying to defend themselves against your false accusations of just trying to create FUD.

That's obviously changed based on the aggressive responses you're giving this time. If answering my questions takes 30% of your time,  it just demonstrates how little time you actually have to commit to the project.
Calling for people on Discord to,  and I quote you "Suffocate fudders with love and respect." in order to bury valid concerns and questions about funds being moved from the wallet and lack of transparency from the Foundation is literally getting the community to pull the wool over their own eyes. 
You've said s couple of times now that the expenses are posted on bitcointalk.  E01's, yes.  Consistently and timely.  The Foundation's, no.  Not until E01 posted the spreadsheet AFTER  I asked why 13% of the funds had already been spent with no accounting.  The very question that got any kind of accounting from the Foundation posted on bitcointalk you dismiss as FUD. (You have an inaccuracy Dec 6 by the way... There's an additional 5.4 million that was sent out that's unaccounted for). You yourself denied on Discord yesterday that over 14m has already been spent,  which means YOU didn't even know until I asked. 
You are literally making false accusations and talking in circles in the hopes of diverting the community's attention away from the real issues,  concerns,  and questions.
Answering questions in a direct,  factual manner as E01 does in far more professional,  and will result in far less replies from concerned community members trying to defend themselves against your false accusations of just trying to create FUD.

About the 5.4 million u say is unaccountable for, please do read this article --> https://medium.com/@electrictrippy/electra-foundation-funds-coin-control-e05bb2534268 it will give you a basic understanding of blockchain and how transactions are handled. The article is written based on the foundations wallet actually.

E01 is indeed very timely with posting on bitcointalk. The fact that we are building the page on on the website is that bitcointalk can be a mess. This fact is stated as you say 13% is spend without accounting. It is me that is posting when big transactions are made. please search back message here with my name: Altfeeder. FYI i'm Bob van Egeraat, the chairman. This i say to make it more clear to you why i post these message. So the funds are not unaccounted for when you search. But point is made, we are switching to the website with our transaction oversight, so this cannot occur any more.

Also, the foundation board, as per our statutes, should meet and vote once per quarter (this is quite normal for a foundation). As the landscape of crypto is very dynamic, we already noticed we sometimes have to have a non sheduled meeting. And make rather quick decisions because of this. It can be a payment that has to be voted upon, contracts that need to be discussed/signed. Meetings with exchanges or other projects for further developments or as a new partner.

To give you a clear explanation on how our (the board) decisions are mostly driven is that a community member (usually a core team) comes to us in need of something. We cannot wait 1 or 2 or even 3 months with a decision, so we shedule an 'official' voting round so we come to conclusion on a matter and vote. It is not that this happens daily as you also will understand, most of our time goes to talking/discussing with other projects and some exchanges for cooperation. The core team is the the team that (mostly, can also be a community member) comes with ideas, leads etc. and the board is there to vote yes or no. 

furthermore, explaining (in detail) all expenses to our community does not make full sense, a little bit of trust on a transaction like the aircoins one (the last one) can be expected from the community towards us imo. All transactions are open to see and by the end of the week all transactions will be live on the website with a short explanation. Also be sure that the dutch tax office is not to play with on that matter, as foundation we have 100% tax exemption, be sure we will have to account for every transaction Do remind yourself of the fact that Raymond, Robert and I are members of a foundation and will be held accountable by Dutch law if we make malicious or not accounted for transactions. Believe me when I say I worry more about getting all transactions, be it FIAT or crypto, in 100% order, then you concern about a 5.4 million transaction (that is actually accounted for as you will probably understand now).

If you have question, contact me on discord.

As an armchair critic,  backseat driver,  fudder, whatever you want to call me,  these are things the teams need to start doing again,  which all seem to have gone by the wayside since the mass exodus of key team members last summer (I know someone,  somewhere,  is going to reply with "they weren't key team members" but they very obviously were or things wouldn't have gotten left like they have). THIS IS CONSTRUCTIVE ADVICE AND IS NOT MEANT AS FUD.
1. Back room updates - these improved transparency immensely.  
2. Proofreading EVERYTHING that gets posted on social media.  The spelling and grammar errors that are regularly in posts now are really unprofessional looking.  
3. Help wanted ads - You keep claiming people should volunteer. To where? The only post I've seen in months is for developers.  
4. Translation team - what happened to getting everything translated for a global community?
5. Engineering call agendas
6. Consistent engineering calls held on the date they're supposed to be
7. Engineering call transcripts for easy access
8. Articles written by ECA with pertinent,  informative content
9. Marketing has pretty much died... what happened to the graphics,  information, updates etc?
10. Current roadmap
11. Updated whitepaper
12. Updated team information.
13. Community input,  opportunities for engineering call content requests

From the time the teams were formed until about July or August almost everything about this coin and its management was impressive, even in a "down" market.  It was constantly growing and evolving.  Sure it had some hiccups,  but the team more than made up for it,  keeping everyone informed and excited on a continuous basis.  
Having talked to many of the team members that left,  their reasons for leaving had nothing at all to do with a down market.
Before you claim not enough time or volunteers, my personal suggestion would be to beg the key people who left to come back. Pay them, take up donations,  use foundation funds... whatever it takes,  just try to get them back.  The ones I can think of are people like Crypto Life, Undertow, Mom, Ivan, Maverick...
Which brings me to my next point on volunteers.  I myself would never personally volunteer for this project because of the way the volunteers are regarded after they leave.  It's made very clear that no matter who it is that leaves,  they didn't really matter and are easily replaceable.  Their reasons are reduced to "they couldn't stick it through" , belittling their contributions and real reasons they had for leaving.  Obviously,  some of them aren't replaceable. For instance,  you'll probably never get volunteers again with the same qualifications and abilities as the people I listed above.  Hell, you can't get people like them for paid positions,  let alone volunteer ones.  
Maverick was one of the most effective marketers or "hype" expert I've ever seen.  
Mom had unbelievable experience and seemed to somehow keep it all under control.
Ivan did massive amounts of development.  
Crypto Life was an expert in pretty much everything,  and an amazing community person.  
Undertow wrote good articles,  and based on everything that was released during his time,  was a professional proofer.  
I don't know who was responsible for each of the things that have been abandoned since they all left,  but you need to get them all back, & the only way you can do that in a timely manner is to try to get some of those key people back.

Thank you for your clear and concise answer, particularly that part which addressed how it's decided what gets paid and how.  Completely understandable that every payment out wouldn't and shouldn't be in full detail.  General terminology would probably work the best ie...Advertising,  Exchange fees,  dues and subscriptions,  etc.  Just like it would be in an accounting program. 
Honestly,  malicious transactions weren't as much my worry as losing track was. As an "outsider", I have no idea what's going on,  who's doing what,  what's spent,  etc.  It really raised a red flag for me when Robert himself didn't appear to know.  My worry went from "they're spending a lot,  quickly,  and no idea what for" to "is anyone even keeping track or monitoring?"
I'm happy to hear that it will all be available on the website this week.
Thank you for all your time and effort.

No problem, I'm here to answer those questions. As you read back my message here on bitcointalk, you'll see the biggest protion of the 13% was due to reimbursment of a wallet bug that was in the desktop wallet. There will be one more later on, about 300K. We know it as quit an extensive amount that is being repayed to community members who lost there funds. But the board, core team and user support, that investigated the bug, founded that we should reimburse these people.

Indeed 'short' clear explanations will be used. If there are really large numbers transfered in the future, ofcourse we will give a more clear explanation about it.

hmm.. I have been looking at my own spreadsheet from the wallet, the online spreadsheet that is on my test server, the image of the spreadsheet that was posted here, the message i made here regarding the payout and the blockexplorer.

I have a clue on where you think it doesn't hold up, be i'm not sure. I do think you mean when you look at the explorer and see the transactions, you also see a strange '4.49M ECa'transaction right? (you can check the transaction here https://www.electraexplorer.com/tx/677727393743cb1418ed03e480503cd8934b5ae9fc0c814ee882128868e51791 ) If this is what you mean, i do get that this can be strange. If this is the problem, i would like to refer you again to the article i've posted some comments above this one (it's a medium article). In this article, 2 community members and me try to explain this phenomenon. If you start following that adress, you should see it's send back to the foundation wallet later on.

If you notice something else that is not correct, please do notify me. A mistake is easily made when entering numbers, i try to be as carefull as i can, but if you see one, please do point it out.

The image shared in here only shows 2 transactions on the 6th for a total of 5000 ECA. 3000 to 9th place,  2000 to 10th place.  Whatever was transferred to winners 1 thru 8 isn't reflected on the spreadsheet E01 shared.  It could either be a spreadsheet error,  or possibly a screenshot that didn't capture the full spreadsheet image?
Try comparing the actual image that was shared in here to your spreadsheet to see if it is just an image problem.

So the premine was 3.34% or 1,002,000,000 ECA

then 2 months later 18,999,999,936 was mined

which means roughly 20,001,999,936 ECA was in circulation in 2 months? 66% of the supply?

does this math make sense?

hello I need a clarification courtesy

After updating the wallet qt 2.0 in a positive way, I understand that the coverage for the electra in stake results in an orphan block dated 01/01/2019, tells me that the transaction was generated but not accepted, I have bought and put in stakje about 30.000 ela on 22/03/2018, I will receive the fee on 22/03/2019 of 11.800 eca of the orphan transaction of 01/01/2019?

Thank you

So I will not receive the reward for the 1 year stake I did?
It seems strange to me that there are no variables to reach the prize but the only condition was to have the coins and leave the wallet for some periods in open stakes.

March 07, 2019, 06:10:46 PM
Sorry, but you obviously did entirely miss-understand the concept of staking. While staking rates are calculated on annual basis, staking reward is for generating a block. You don't get reward if your wallet is not selected to add a block to the blockchain. If your wallet generates a bloc, the reward will be calculated automatically for the time since it was deposited at this address and not moved (if it staked previously, that stake counted as moving coins..) - Reward will be pro rata (for the time that has passed since last movement), but on annual basis.

When you deposited your coins on 22/03/2018, the Electra-wallet version was still QT 1.2, and the (annualized) reward would have been 50%. But - as you only deposited 30k coins, you would likely never stake, because this amount was mostly far to low to ever stake in 1.2.

Then, in the beginning of october 2018, a new wallet was declared mandatory, the 1.3 version. This increased the number of blocks, but dramatically reduced the staking reward, to 2.5 % - annually. Obviously, you missed that update, so you continued staking on the old - "Pre-Fork 1" chain. As most people, and at least most with large wallets, adopted to 1.3 eventually, the number of coins that were staked on 1.2 wallets plummeted, and thus staking became easier. This is the reason that you did "receive" a reward of 11'800 ECA on 01/01/2019 (the amount would be correct if 50 % would still be the rule, as it was on the 1.2 wallets..) - but this reward - this stake - only happened on the 1.2 Chain, which - by most people - is considered worthless...

Now, in February, a massiv Upgrade of the Network happened, with migration to an entirely new Blockchain, using QT 2.0.x wallets. When you did this update, the new blockchain only accepted those transactions that would be valid on that chain, that is transactions that are valid with the 1.3 wallet before the second Fork Block at 182'750. And this means that all transactions that were generated on the 1.2 chain after block 112'200 (if I recall correctly) - are invalid (non-existent) on the actual chain.

So, if you continue staking, you might still generate a block on the new chain, and eventually gain the reward for the full time (although only at a rate of 2.5% annually, at the moment, scheduled to decrease further...). The reward is not due at a given date, so it will not be paid after the year is complete, but whenever you generate a block... (that is - earlier or later). Unfortunately, 30k ECA is probably still on the lower end for ever getting a stake - although at the present high number of blocks generated, the threshold has certainly come down much.

Ohh you are back from one more mini-break. Do you go on a break to think what should be the next move to spread FUD?

Anyways if you can see community developers like Ruru, Jenova and Nash are working continuously by staying public and not everyone likes to be in front some prefer to work in the background like you are working spreading FUD continuously by creating a fake account and not revealing your identity.

Anyways as long as project is moving we don't care who is working on the project is it external or internal who cares.

So please come up with something new now.

What will happen once we reach the maximum circulating supply? Will we not receive any staking reward after that?



Apfelgluck
March 14, 2019, 12:05:04 PM
The reward is halving every year so it will take couple of decades to reach the total supply.

Also POS coins have no hard cap on supply not just ECA but all the POS coins so coins continue to get added even after supply is reach.


That's how POS coins work but still it will take few decades to reach that stage.

I  have decided to contribute 2,000,000 ECA to the current pool IF we win the voting contest.

I am very interested in PolisPay. Groestlcoin's partnership announcement with Polispay on March 8 may be the leading reason why their value increased by 300% and their volume by more than 33000% by March 12. I believe it will also have a very good effect on Electra by allowing it to have more practical uses in daily life. We have 15,000 more Twitter followers than the vote leader so we can potentially get many more votes than them. I urge all stakeholders to vote if you are interested in adding value to your holdings.

Dear Stakeholders,

100,000,999 ECA pre-mine (10% of remaining) has been converted to BTC for risk management purposes. Minor diversification is important at this stage and will allow for continued growth of the Electra project during undesirable market conditions.

I will consider buying back the amount that was sold if there is major opposition to this conversion.



ryt0_l0rd

Good Move E01

Seeing the crypto market it's always better to have some funds consolidated into BTC when market can move either way.

As exchanges or other work needs payment in BTC mostly and not altcoins.

So excellent move keeping the long term vision in mind.

Thank again for being so transparent and mentioning everything and keeping all of us informed 



Electra01 March 24, 2019, 12:46:12 PM 
I am told the term "risk management purposes" has created confusion. By this I mean being 100% in one asset is risky nothing else.

Electra01 April 02, 2019, 12:37:29 PM

Dear Stakeholders,

Today is the 2nd anniversary of Electra's launch on Bitcointalk. What has been achieved in the past year is phenomenal.

- We have upgraded to a new blockchain.
- Dedicated community members registered a foundation dedicated to Electra in the Netherlands.
- Many, many new exchanges have listed Electra.
- Hardware, web and mobile wallets made available.
- Amazing partnerships formed that will enable us to reach a larger network of potential users.
- New community roadmap and whitepaper created.
- Live video guides/calls/meetings created.
- Much more reference material regarding Electra made available.
- Electra was involved in multiple charities.
- Electra was involved in blockchain expos.
- Community was involved in voting, selecting new parameters for upgrades, crowd funding and forming ties with other projects.

Achievements can be viewed in more detail here.

Electra's new Proof-of-Stake Version 3 Extended (POS v3.0e) consensus is pioneered by our team. It fixes vulnerabilities that existed in POS 3.0 and distributes stakes proportionally. You can read more on Electra's new POS consensus in the community whitepaper. I personally feel lucky to have worked with such dedicated, ambitious and honest people on improving Electra. I am also very thankful to our stakeholders who have played a large part in many exchange listings by voting, for helping out other users in our communication channels and providing us with feedback. I look forward to the remainder of the year with excitement.

Hi guys

Seems that I missed the fork and my electra wallet wasn't online for a long time. I tried to install the new Electra wallet, but I couldn't recover my wallet. Is that even possible after the fork or are my coins worthless now?

Regards




Electra01
A pril 12, 2019, 11:00:01 PM

We had a guide during the upgrade period but it seems to have been taken down. Basically:

1) Backup your wallet.dat file found in %appdata%/Electra. Do not overwrite it or delete it.

2) Except for wallet.dat, delete everything regarding Electra. Both program files and the content in %appdata%/Electra.

3) Install the new desktop wallet. Run once and close. Then put your own backed up wallet.dat file into %appdata%/Electra in place of the newly generated wallet.dat


Let us know if this worked for you. If not, write here, to our Discord or to https://electra-support.org/ and we'll resolve this.

Hope so you have check the past achivements on website if not here is the link: https://electraproject.org/roadmap/

And do let me know if anyone is having such strong blockchain or not.

Also for your reminder ETN (raised 40 Million USD during ICO) suffered double spend attack & PolisPay failed to implement POS 3.0 and gave a failed fork

But for Electra both are secured with no millions of dollars raised

they were sold on coindeal at the date announced at 7 sat on a purchase wall of +300,000,000 eca, I saw the order in the history.

votes by the community are for the foundation not the premine , take the opportunity to criticize but it was never said otherwise (and it reprensents -3% of market and funds are still for electra)

for the moment and for 2 years electra01 has always respected what he said if it changes I would be the first to criticize him believe me.

Electra01
April 25, 2019, 05:42:36 AM
Dear stakeholders,
I have a couple of announcements to make.


Announcement 1:
There has been opposition by parts of the community regarding the amount hedged and so a gradual buyback was made as promised. Expect a total amount of about 46,500,000 ECA to be transferred to the wallet within 24 hours from multiple sources.


Announcement 2:
We are in the process of developing an Android wallet for Electra. There is a tough decision to make:

Option 1: We can either have a staking wallet with pruning as originally promised but due to the recent increase in block size it could potentially take up about 3 GB even in pruned state assuming blocks are full. A reduction of our block size or some other modification to the blockchain would be necessary if this path is chosen so that it takes up less space. With staking mode turned on, phone battery will be reduced quicker. Also network security may be impacted if people prefer staking on mobile. On the plus side you will be able to stake on the go 24/7.

Option 2: We can have a wallet that is non-staking and pruned. It will take up less space and consume less phone battery than a staking mobile wallet. This one will take a shorter amount of time to develop.

Whichever one is chosen, I will consider my long term goal of "create Android mobile staking wallet with pruning" complete. So if you have strong opinions on one or the other make it known here. I will mainly rely on the opinion of the foundation and stakeholder comments/votes while making this decision.

You may vote for your preference here:

Then I will go for non-staking mobile wallet.

Using SPV light weight wallet it will make sure the mobile performance is not impacted and security of network remains unaffected.

So it's better to focus more on security that on fancy features.

If in future need arises which I highly doubt we can think of getting mobile staking option as well but presently we don't need such

Thank you

	







vishals_019
Hello,

I am Vishal and I would like to inform the ECA Community member that one of the oldest team member who worked since the very beginning of the project finally left Electra Project.

His name is Aman Singh

He was among the most respected and trustworthy team member but unfortunately without saying anything he deleted his telegram account & discord as well.

If anyone post a message asking where is Aman or why he left the project the admins will simply delete the message and directly ban the account who asked about Aman.

There is a censorship going on and for some weird reason they are trying to hide why Aman left without saying anything.

So I have created an account here so atleast someone can answer what happened all of sudden that a person who was trusting ECA so much, worked day in day out for the project against all the ODDS suddenly left the project.

What is team hiding with the community that Aman found out and left the project?

I know some will say I am trying to say negative stuff but if this is not true that Aman left the project I would apologize to the whole community.

They banned me from main group saying I am sending DMs to people, If there is censorship in main group and someone like Aman left the project I guess we investors have the right to know what's wrong with it & if it was not allowed in main chat I messaged few of main chat members to know if they are aware of it or not.

So I hope someone will let me know why Aman Singh left ECA?

	






IcathTrade
April 26, 2019, 06:50:58 AM

From what i see, you have been banned because you were spamming users and you threatened to create FUD, saying it is not a problem for you to do that, proof by screenshot shared  

Also, about Aman, as it was said, no one knows at this time, me, you and the team. He just deleted his social accounts

So before spread non-information; wait for a real answer.

I just hope nothing bad happened to Aman and he is fine. <3

	


vishals_019
April 26, 2019, 07:11:48 AM
Lol let me bring the truth in front of you as well then.

1) Your team members are spreading that Aman earlier was inactive for months as well after CM which is totally fake you can cross check he was active all the time during and after CM by checking his messages in main chat and in announcement channel.

Artur said all the above things (screenshot can be shared    ) so stop disrespecting a person who have put thousands of hours for the project in last 18 months. If the project can't respect his efforts atleast ask your admins to stop disrespecting his commitment towards the project.

2) I was already muted and when the team didn't said anything about him leaving then being an ECA holder I have the rights to message some people in the community and share with them so they can ask in main chat (Which when someone tried the message was deleted and the account was banned)

3) Yeah I have posted the question for the real answer only.

4) And Aman is absolutely fine that I can tell you so nothing bad happened to him that's for sure



IcathTrade
April 26, 2019, 07:30:05 AM	 #3093

Of course Aman was active a lot, he made the new website for example^^ I even don't understand what you are saying....

And a real answer was given, the team doesn't know the reason at this time. But you just think they are lying, it's wrong and just your personal point of view.

But well, you are known by the whole community as toxic and negative guy in any situation...

So continue to do like you always did, no problem with that.

Have a good day Vishal 



cryt0_l0rd
April 26, 2019, 07:54:18 AM

vishals_019 April 26, 2019, 07:55:03 AM

Then can you please ask Artur to stop spreading that Aman goes inactive for months and have done this earlier as well. If yes then can you tell us when he left the project? And if he came back why he was again allowed to join the project as he had left the project already?

It's not me saying above things it was told by Artur one of the ECA admin who you remember was banning everyone from tip bot group when someone took Rapids name or were there in Rapids group

Same admin once again spreading negativity against a team member in DM

So he needs to understand 1st and learn how to respect a team member even if he decides to leave the project and move on.

The whole community even know that whatever points I raised are always correct just the way I speak is not ethical.

April 26, 2019, 08:08:45 AM

cryt0_l0rd April 26, 2019, 08:13:56 AM
Maybe they have not said anything because he never left the project

I think it just funny cause you left the Electra team before, more than one time

I feel sorry for you as whoever is your "source" for proving such information is giving you incorrect info.

You need to change the person so atleast someone will provide the correct info.

To correct you I had dropped the roles of "core team" last year same month that is April 2018 but remain "Team Member" always   

I have never left Electra Project and I will never leave Electra Project

And I guess it's normal to ask to remove your role when you don't feel you are doing enough to get the core team tag.

I guess that's what community project means. Earlier when there were few team members I got the core team tag and now when there are more who are working better than me they deserve the recognization and appreciation.

So you don't worry for me I am here to stay so please use someone else name to spread your shit.

And if you so interested about me let's have a video chat my friend you and me and let's discuss in front of the whole community.

I would love to answer about myself when you ask questions about me on video call.

Will be good to know who you are as you have so much interest in Electra so need to know the die hard fan of ECA

Let me know when you want just tell me the time atleast a day early and I will manage the schedule as per your time zone.

Thanks

I would love nothing more than to have a video chat with you!

Not sure how much questions you can answer since you never do enough for core team tag.

Let me get all my questions then we can schedule everything

This will be fun Mr. Aman Singh

Yeah it will be fun. And I will take one more suggestion from your message.

Regarding checking the identity using photo and present date so will on call do it with our Government Issued Identity.

As you say you are or were part of the project so hiding behind a fake name doesn't look good right.

let's verify the identity as well mine as Aman Singh and yours as ______ ??

Will be waiting for your message   

Thanks

And from chatting with you on discord I will chatting with you on call.

Will be amazing as it will be going back to 2018

You can name it as "core team member" reunion   

So won't be replying  any further now whenever you have time let me know we will do it just see my time zone is IST if you don't know
Thanks again

So will manage how I will look or how my face will look   

I hope now your next message will be the video call date and not something else

And if you want some answer from a specific person you can send me the question for that as well and I will get an answer for you. Even ready to do that as well.

What do you think?




cryt0_l0rd
April 30, 2019, 04:13:23 AM
Hope so you have check the past achivements on website if not here is the link: https://electraproject.org/roadmap/

And do let me know if anyone is having such strong blockchain or not.

Also for your reminder ETN (raised 40 Million USD during ICO) suffered double spend attack & PolisPay failed to implement POS 3.0 and gave a failed fork

But for Electra both are secured with no millions of dollars raised

There is continous activity on github as well. The community is active.

The volume maybe low but it's same for 90% alt coins and that's not the point of worry as right now it's BTC season people are confused if BTC will go up or remain stable or it will take down direction.

See BTC domination from 50% to 55% so people are moving money from alt coins to BTC to ride the BTC wave once settle the btc money will flow in altcoins again.

It's been a while since I came here
Just a reminder to warn you of this hoax, the management team in the person of Master Den and his accomplices robbed me over 160 million pieces
And to believe the discussions on the networks I'm not the only one
I would always be here to remind you of this scam in the months and years to come

hello,

i have a question in regards the eca who was converted to btc. How will this btc used to benefit the project? maybe for listing fees or at least for marketing?

greetings



Electra01 May 20, 2019, 03:37:12 PM


Half of the ECA sold has already been bought back as I mentioned before. The remainder will stay hedged for the long term. This conversion was not done to immediately spend it all. It was done so there is a reserve from other sources if needed. The reserve will eventually prioritize funding technical development rather than marketing or exchange fees. When spent on Electra, the stakeholders will be notified.

I don't see the electra bought back on the premine addresses.

Is it planned to pay the developers and the electra team for the last update (BIP130 BIP68, mobile wallet)? Because for the moment you never announced paying for anything and the team did it on their own.

Also can we know the exact amounts of the "diversified" reserve (excluding eca)?

Thank you, we need transparency and regular updates on the amounts / adress wallets

I also wanted to know what you are working on in concrete terms at the moment, because I only see technical updates from the foundation and the team and never from you.

Around 2.64 BTC went into the ECA buyback. 1 BTC each for Zcash, ETH, Golem, Civic. Rest is in BTC. Nothing has been spent.

There will be about 29 million not included in the total balance. That is in Cryptopia and they were unable to transfer it after announcing the buyback. This amount will be added after they finish their liquidation.

Hello!
I have a question.
The formula for calculating the award is:

((2.5% * number of coins) * (days unspent)) / 365

For example, I buy 1,000,000 coins and hold them for 30 days.

((2.5% * 1000000)*(30))/365=(25000*30)/365=2055 coins per month

That is, after spending $ 400, for a month I will get $ 0.65   

This is nonsense!
What then is the point of buying this coin?



IcathTrade
June 06, 2019, 07:01:23 AM
Y up it's that. 2.5% yearly

Better than bank interest, better than Bitcoin (0%), better than ETH (0%) ect...  you see what i mean?
Electra is not a coin we buy to have rewards, if it's your main goal you made a mistake  

Also - it means as well a very low sell pressure. So when the price starts to grow, stakers don't dump the price with the stake rewards, it's a win win.


Andrey123

Ok but even if you have 2.5% yearly you have to hope all year long that the average buy price you had doesn't drop more than 2.5%.

Lol. That's your response? But, yes, that's correct in a glass mostly empty way. A parallel example is if you bought bitcoin, or any other non staking coin on the planet, and a year later it's down 2.5%, you've lost 2.5%. With ECA you haven't....You can frame a hypothetical any way you want.......What's the point of your post? ECA is a staking coin, but isn't designed to make you a lambo by holding coins. It's a payment system in development with incentive to hold and prevent inflation. I myself believe that if you buy a coin and it goes up 5%, you're up. If it goes down 5%, you're down (if you sell)....That should be all clear now.

For how long does somebody have to lock the coins at least in order to be eligible for the staking rewards?

It starts automatically 12hours after the deposit, then the staking time depends of many factors.

Cryptobridge is delisting ELECTRA on the 25th of november along 50+ more coins. I can help you out withdraw your coins from CryptoBridge for a fee through another solution. Minimal trust involved, not full trust of your assets. Same for everybody else that has problems. As they are delaying KYC's and doing everything in their power to keep the coins so they can dump after that. All I ask is a fee and a review so I can help more people. I will provide my social media accounts also in case you want them, but for this solution you will see it's not truly necessary.

You can contact me on discord : Equilibrium#1004  or  telegram : @Equ1Librium

We have discussed this issue before.

Never give control of your wallet to another person unless you absolutely trust them.

I had nothing to do with the 160 million ECA loss you are claiming and neither did Electra's codebase.

Accusing the entire project to be a scam is far-fetched and unfounded.

I should look into regathering my ECA that I had ages ago. Back when cryptopia was up I had a small stash of ECA, but then when cryptopia went under I ended up losing pretty much all of it. Do you know if this project is doing any bounties or airdrops currently as well?

Dear Stakeholders,

I have been in contact with Robert Bakker of the Electra Foundation these past days. They have come to the final stage of negotiations with a top exchange which has been operating since 2013. It is well known but I am not allowed to name it. If I ask you to name two top exchanges founded in that year, you will probably guess it. Electra has passed all required criteria and the screening stage. There is some extra funding needed to make it happen. The Electra Foundation has set up a fundraiser here:

https://electraproject.org/exchange-listing-donations/

I will also donate from private funds because it is one that I have always dreamed of seeing Electra listed on in order to boost liquidity, prestige and accessibility. I commend the work the foundation and community have done in these negotiations.

@Electra01 what contribution did you make to the donation, is it okay for you to publish it?




Electra01
May 29, 2020, 07:48:19 PM
I have already made a donation. As it is from private funds I will not likely publish an exact figure or location just as no one else donating is required to.

However, it seems I need to give a ballpark figure because I have already gotten many enquiries about it. The percentage of the current amount donated that is from me is 200%-500% greater than the percentage of total ECA I control (project funds included). I hope this answer and amount will be sufficient.

Looking at the fact that the extra 2 BTC daily volume created by the news surrounding the fundraiser is greater than the 1 BTC required, I am confident we are on track to reaching the goal.

Yes   

Install the new wallet version (v2.1.1) from website, run it once then close it when you are in the main wallet page.
Go to the Electra folder (%appdata%\Electra for windows or Application support\Electra for mac), delete the new wallet.dat created and copy/paste your backup in the folder.
Be sure the file is well called wallet.dat once pasted.

Run the wallet and wait for the full sync in order to see your balance appearing.

Thank you @E01 for the kind words and the donation. I'm glad the word is out, it is going to be HITBTC with a BTC, ETH and USDT pair listing. It seems that the community appreciated the news as price surged over 150% in the past week. Coming weeks the listing will be done at HITBTC.

Also I'd like to mention that we expect ECA to go live on Next.Exchange early access in coming weeks and we hope to announce yet another Exchange listing next monday. This exchange is small but listed on CMC and will give us following fiat pairs: EUR, USD, BRL, GBP, RUR, UAH, TRY and KZT. Nice to mention is that this exchange is setup to comply with EU regulation and has applied for a National Bank license in The Netherlands.

N ovember 17, 2020, 09:56:11 AM

well done and thank you for what you did. (irony)

Electra01 you are the biggest crook ever seen and you are not ashamed of anything.

- You have never provided any work since 2018 and you are completely useless. (0.00 work not even the smallest thing)

You have never participated or offered anything in 2 years (except thank us) and you have just sold AGAIN the premine which was for the project (supposedly) for your own account.

Besides, you had already sold a lot of the premine in altcoin and I have messages with you telling you not to buy shitcoin (Golem ect ...) if it is for the project and you literally shit me on it in basically saying "no I do what I want".

In the end everything has fallen and you have no funds for the project after having massacred it with massive sales and you still continue to massacre it.
You are the worst manager and you do not want to give custody to the foundation which has a legal entity.
We have never changed or betrayed your trust in the code by blocking or recovering this premine, but you don't respect anything.

 They are NOT you funds but those of the premine for the project!


Unlike you I have worked ALL the time since 2017-2018 on electra but it's over. Well done for having us scam and I hope that you are indeed anonymous and that you did not leave a trace to find yourself (for a jugement/justice)

farewell
Without any respect for you

Electra01
November 17, 2020, 06:05:26 PM
I would like to explain what led me to the decisions I took this past month. Firstly I must mention I have not done anything illegal or, to my knowledge, contradictory to any messages I have written previously. I am also not anonymous. An exchange leaked my identity years ago.

Ever since 2017, the largest funding for the project has been provided by me either directly or indirectly. I have been directly involved in two vital hard forks and many exchange negotiations until asked to step aside.

I am severely concerned that after multiple requests to the team over the past 2 months, I have not been shown the new code or been allowed to observe its progress. The potential possibilities of what is being done with the code seriously worry me. As I am not able to see the new code or who is working on it and therefore I do not know what direction the project is taking or what will change which is a very irregular position for a founder and primary donator to be put in. It is a red flag for me and hence I took the decision to reduce the ECA exposure of the funds I control. The removal of this thread link (my preferred line of communication) from Coinmarketcap a day after my previous post was also a factor in this decision. I will scale back in when the uncertainty regarding the code no longer exists.

There seems to be misconception about the definition of the pre-mine which I should clarify. The initial pre-mine is 1,000,000,019 as mentioned on day 1. It is not 1,600,000,000 as some people are insisting. It is recorded in the blockchain, unchangeable along with all expenditures which stand at 705,913,613 (hedge not included) of which a least 550,000,000 have gone to team and community projects. I offered to give the remainder of the pre-mine to the foundation after the team insisted but the offer got rejected and I was demanded to include the stakes and part with 880,000,000. Stakes are not pre-mine.

I have never guaranteed profits or told anyone to buy or sell Electra. In terms of transparency, Electra is in the top tier of the blockchain industry. Do not buy a cryptocurrency if you have concerns with it. There are 7000+ other options to choose from. In USD terms, an extremely high amount was invested into the development of the Electra blockchain and it is one of the best out there today. My issue is with the information being withheld from me and the team's uncompromising attitude towards me. Not the project itself.



Robofus
November 17, 2020, 07:46:33 PM
t's really upsetting how you feel about the whole project team spending weeks / months and even 3 years on this project. Haven't you seen what has been done over the past 3 years by these volunteers?

By the way, the code is not hidden at all. Everything can be seen through the github. Plus, if you've ever read the media articles, they've highlighted multiple times and even disclosed potential improvements to come (which could never be done without these guys who have always been loyal)

You have to show your real intentions by redeeming the parts and sending them back to the pre-mine. With this, the community will appreciate and understand your continued and honest support for your created project.

Are you brave enough to do this?

Electra01 November 18, 2020, 03:51:37 AM
I am aware we have had great talent contribute to the project.

Github has the current version. The upcoming code is in a private room. I need to see the hot code and the Discord discussion group for the new version. Please provide links if you have them so I can check them out. PM if you want I don't mind.

they are not at their first scams
I have proof of what I put forward, the exchanges of messages that I had published on Discord but of course they were deleted and I was banned
quit this shit and get on other much more serious projects, there are so many



Robofus November 23, 2020, 09:27:03 PM
The code is not in a private room, no one has access to it, everyone works alone and we can check it together once it's done.

This is the first time in 3 years that you ask us for the code and that you use it as an excuse to sell the premine because you think we have something to hide?

I don't understand how you can do this when WE have always been transparent. Unlike you.

FIRST POINT = You sold tons of electra from the premine on your own account without giving us any proof of TXIDs of other blockchains, altcoins adress, proof of expense ...

 SECOND POINT = you pretend that the stakes of the premine are not the premine ? And you say the foundation refuses your offer? But accepting it would not have been honest because it is not what should be done.

No one honest can say that the stakes of the premine does not belong to the premine for the project! So change your mind today or assume being a scammer who will be judged for it.

THIRD POINT = If you are so transparent why October 23 did you sold huge amounts of electra from the premine? You did not indicate anything here to be transparent?

On November 16 the foundation asked you why you sold the 23 october? You STILL SOLD huge amount of electra on November 17th and you answered afterwards "because I don't trust the version 3 code that is not shown to me."

I repeat if you don't understand = THIS CODE DOES NOT EXIST FOR ANYONE YET

and TODAY, 23 november you still sell without saying anything?
is that your transparency?
-------------------------
So you sold SEVERAL HUNDREDS OF MILLION electra premine 3 times in 1 month under false statements and without any transparency. ( Your pretext it's like asking to resuscitate a dead person or you sell the "premine".)

I asked you to be brave enough to redeem and you deflect the problem.

besides today can you give us a COMPLETE and precise inventory (address and TXID) of the accounts of the premine? Since the old one is no longer up to date and you do not respect transparency.

You should take me seriously and re-buy today the premine sold and be transparent.

And if you decline and prefer to be publicly displayed as a scammer, maybe it is time to reveal your full ID Eren Ö ? I've always kept my word and hope I don't need to say more.

Electra01, hi, with respect and careful consideration & contemplation, I write this message to you as a long term holder of ECA & a community member that shared in the vision & ethos of the project albeit as a simple investor too.
 
It is a most unfortunate outcome that an entire team of good, decent & dedicated & tirelessly hardworking people, whom have in totality carried, progressed & evolved the ECA project quite superbly over several years, have now reached a decision to leave the project en masse. Frankly, it would be reasonable to say it is a tragedy without being over dramatic at all. Nevertheless here we are.

I see that nobody else has chosen to post here in your preferred forum of communication since the announcement made by the team yesterday, yet I feel compelled to ask you a very simple question, what are your intentions now regarding ECA?

It is said that everybody thinks they are correct and right from their own perspective, alas & inevitably whilst that might be true, that very perspective that is held without having a truly balanced & deeper consideration to a much bigger picture, can and usually does lead to an outcome such as the current one regarding ECA.

Imho, we must & should always feel compelled to gracefully & generously & authentically weigh up & give credence & value to the perspectives of others in order for equitable and satisfactory outcomes to be reached. Especially when there are thousands of people potentially affected, this should be incumbent upon us unequivocally in all aspects of our decision making processes whereby what we choose to do can impact the lives of others in a myriad of ways & consequences.

Rather than engage in mud slinging or vitriolic negativity lets please engage in the truth underpinned by integrity & honesty. I am sure you never imagined or envisioned back in 2017 that all these years later, the current 'malaise' would transpire. So, again I respectfully ask you, where do you choose to go from here with ECA? A precise & comprehensive answer from you, whilst not demanded or expected, it would I am certain, be immensely appreciated by many people.


Thank you.

Electra01 / https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=944561 has been unmasked as the most deceivefull person we can imagine. His only task was to gain only bitcoin by making false promises to the current team. He used these funds for his own benefit to pay for his expensive lifestyle. His own selfish character almost bomb the project to literally zero.

Please beware of this fraudulent person ( Electra01 ) and don't believe a single word he is saying or trying to make you believe. He discredited himself multiple times so this is a fair warning for the people from the future: Stay away, don't believe: Electra01. He will serve you the cake, but when you are not looking. He will eat the cake himself and then try to convince you that you ate it yourself.

The current team did the right thing by choosing for the future of the project and people around it. ECA is the past, long live ECAP.




kxz1498 November 28, 2020, 03:11:22 AM Yup. 
Fucking thief and scammer. Quietly selling pre-mine to fuel his greed. ECAP is the way to go now.



Electra01: November 28, 2020, 04:13:17 PM





Dear stakeholders,

A couple of days ago, some rogue users recklessly announced an unauthorized fork with unpublished/un-reviewed code, created FUD and directly caused the price of ECA to crash by 90% which was the highest daily crash since the bonanza. I anticipated a risk of such a move which is actually what provoked me to preemptively reduce my ECA position. I was not permitted to see the code or related discussions so I assumed a malicious move was imminent and I have been proven right. I believe this move was going to happen whether I had scaled out or not but as a result of my actions, they were forced to execute this plan quicker. Sadly, I realized it too late to stop it completely.

I am committed to ECA and have taken steps to resolve the issue in a manner that will benefit current ECA holders. As a result of part of the team breaking off and creating a new fork and coin brand called ECAP which will give a 1:1 airdrop to most ECA holders, I have decided to take two drastic measures to attempt to preserve ECA's unity, stability and ensure it remains the primary chain in order to maximize the wealth of current holders. Firstly, the foundation will have received all remaining pre-mine by the time of this announcement. Secondly, I will no longer control any stakes by the time of this announcement. There were enough buy orders available to fully sell all 300,000,000+ ECA staked holdings in multiple exchanges in the past 24 hours.

By doing these actions, I have kept my word by having the entire pre-mine guaranteed for the project which preserves Electra's legitimacy and as stakes no longer exist in publically viewable accounts, there will probably be no reason left for unnecessary, wealth-reducing splits ever again. Despite being out of all publicly viewable positions, I will continue to write in this forum for Electra. As I currently have no significant holdings, either chain's performance will minimally affect me and if one version of the chain ceases to exist I will buy whichever one becomes the primary chain. In the end it is up to the stakeholders, the foundation and team to decide which will become the primary chain. Whichever chain prevails, I accept the result and am glad it will finally resolve an issue that has dragged on for four years.


I created a comparison table to help stakeholders decide on the primary chain.

ECA	ECAP
_________________	_________________
No pre-mine or stakes controlled by EO1	No pre-mine or stakes controlled by EO1
Existing foundation + 194,086,398 ECA bonus	No foundation to fund project or if they pick ECAP over ECA they will lose 194,086,398 ECAP as donation was after 23 Nov

let's check this and have fun!!!

announced an unauthorized fork with unpublished/un-reviewed code

Is there only one example since the blockchain technology exists, that an open source code needs an authorization to be forked? 

Also i have read nowhere that the team will do a fork, nore a swap. It is explicit in their announcement that it is a new chain, so new genesis block.


i wanted to stop reading here cuz it was already funny enough....

But i will prepare a detailed answer, with proof of your lies, wait a bit please

"some rogue users"
Are you talking about the volunteer team which did 100% of the work and which created 100% of the dev and social medias when you did and have nothing?
that team that did all the work when you absolutely never did anything?

it's you the rogue

the team had to announce this unplanned airdrop because you do not respond and instead, you were selling the project premine. And you say you had to anticipate that? by selling in advance??? (best joke)

Why didn't you answer my questions and wait 5 days without a response while you were still loging to sell the premine every day?

why are you giving this money to the foundation when they have asked you this since 2018? it no longer has any interest or value. everyone goes to ECAP. (except you)

why don't you donate the BTC and altcoins from the premine to the foundation? to pay T1 exchanges? to pay servers? to pay integrations? to pay development?

Why you always refused?

Why were you not transparent during the sales of the last 40 days and avoid answering?

why do you say that the stakes of the premine do not belong to the premine (and therefore to the foundation) when you said you should cover $ 1000 in 2017? and only need 100 million at this price (2017 price lol)  so why did you sell 700 million stakes for your personal account?

Very transparent and trustful  

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1848351.msg21138302#msg21138302

why you lie and do not understand that no code is hidden neither ECA nor ECAP?

The ECAP code is under development and we had to announce a non-planned snapshot in order to be able to block your rogue movements.

how to say that the code is not verified if the ECAP wallet does not exist?

Mostly, I think you don't understand anything about code and blockchain. Reading your text, it will be clear for everyone....

you said you don't have a personal eca when we know you have, now you're saying the opposite?

and the problem on ECA is not resolved!!! Since today on November 28 you bought a lot of eca with BTC obtained by illegally selling the premine.

conclusion = stay away from ECA from now on and don't believe E01, never, it's a liar.

November 28, 2020, 08:10:38 PM

Thank you.

first you didn't respond to this and i would like to understand you:
Then, your comparison table.

I want to mention that this is YOUR point of view, and of course you perfectly have full right to express it.

And so, my turn:
/!\ Bellow from your statement /!\  listed to this form =>ECA has: XXX >> ECAP has XXX:



No pre-mine or stakes controlled by E01 >> No pre-mine or stakes controlled by EO1

Ok so we start by the biggest joke....

Why?

=> You sold all the premine in the shadow, acting like any exit-scam founders in crypto history.

e.g: the last month, since October 23.
Your deposit address in coinfalcon, the easiest to find. From premine > to an address > to cold wallet of coinfalcon well known.
3 transactions, and only the deposit addresses are used to access the cold.
 
http://electraexplorer.info/address/EeUZHkxP12NQtsZzDZZzzkQ76BM9PG8ZNL

More than ONE BILLION you sent to this exchange, and of course you didn't sold only here, you are responsible of the 'go to 0' in STEX as well.

Remember this: Blockain NEVER lies and we can track all until the genesis.

ECAProtocol part : TRUE

-----------------------------------------------------------

Existing foundation + 194,086,398 ECA bonus >> No foundation to fund project or if they pick ECAP over ECA they will lose 194,086,398 ECAP as donation was after 23 Nov

well... this is the most pathetic part of your post....

Foundation asks you since 2 years to put the premine in hand of the ONLY ONE legal entity of the project, you always found excuses to not do it. Today we know why....

How do you think it makes you looking? You sold all as exit scam, and in a last attempt to not consider yourself as a thief, you sent a small part?

Ho... important point. A premine IS a premine. You have stacked the premine during a so long time, AGAINST the request to stop this from the team AND from the community!!!
Then you have decided that the stakes were suddenly your own coins??? How is it even possible to say this???

ECAProtocol part : you seem to not understand at all the term "new chain" and what it means for the project foundation

-----------------------------------------------------------

Proven brand name + Multiple existing exchanges >>    Spinoff coins from main branch rarely succeed + No exchanges and will require thousands of USD to be gathered from stakeholders to get listed

Haaaa this is the first thing which makes sense, congrats, the ECA part of this statement is correct!

Except than you forgot the community team AND the community is the ONLY reason for this, which is for sure important to mention, right?

You have not contributed to the brand's renown. Worst you tried to sink the project with your actions... again, today we know why....

ECAProtocol part : AGAIN this is one more proof that you didn't care at all of Electra since the beginning, saying such things... it's only because you have no clue on how the team manages the project. If so, you would not say such non sense...
 
-----------------------------------------------------------

EO1 has private holdings on 23 Nov  > EO1 will get a 1:1 airdrop on all private holdings that existed on 23 Nov

wow... you think that the team who did everything since December 2017 has not managed this already?
You really have a high opinion of yourself and a low one of the team.

ECAProtocol part : wait and see?

-----------------------------------------------------------

All infrastructure in place >> Will have to deal with getting into CMC and creating a block explorer etc.

I can't believe what i read.... at this point it becomes clear that you really don't realize what you are writing.

Who created and host the explorer? > TEAM
Who created and host ALL 3rd parties interfaces? > TEAM
Who created and get the ownership of ALL the products? > TEAM
Who paid for ALL of this? > TEAM

Well, it will be faster to do in the over way, what do you have for electra?

A weebly website and BTC from selling premine of the project for your own interest. Did i forget something?

-----------------------------------------------------------

EO1 donated all pre-mine to the project so all initial EO1 objectives are obsolete >> EO1 received no 1:1 airdrop for the pre-mine so all initial EO1 objectives are obsolete

If you read all the above, is it still necessary to talk about the first part....

There is one SUPER interesting thing you say here, "all initial EO1 objectives are obsolete".

Very strange as it was one of your excuses to not send the premine to the foundation: Because of your OWN ROADMAP.

Again, again, and again : Today we know why....

-----------------------------------------------------------

Twitter and Medium account owners defected to ECAP >> Will start with a decent number of Twitter followers and active Medium page

Second correct statement, not bad.

Yes the community as told above is the main reason of the success of ECA, community created everything that exist and so are the owners.

-----------------------------------------------------------
 
Unique code, reviewed and published for public viewing >> New unknown/unproven code which is, as of yet, unpublished
 
YES !

This is what is called "Open Source". And the team can be proud of that!!!
 
ECAProtocol part : obviously you don't get this point either, the new code for ECAProtocol is the V3.0 update which was supposed to be the new massive update of Electra blockchain, if you didn't destroy it all. Yes, it's not yet public, as it's still under development. As ECAProtocol is an open source project as well, EVERYONE will have access to the code before the release, able to compile by themselves, fork, update, make change ect....
Basic crypto stuff...
 
-----------------------------------------------------------
 
Established business partnerships >> No partnerships
 
And we finish this by this wonderful statement, which is also interesting in fact!
 
What partnership do you have?
What support do you provide for these partnership?
What's your capacities to maintain this?
 
From what we know as community, your only act was to pay a dev to create Electra back in 2017, from a fork of Iceberg coin. And... hmmm... nope, that's good enough.
 
I guess when you have writen this in your comparison table, You must have exchanged ECA and ECAP probably.
 
So far from what i have read, all the partnerships follow the team in ECAProtocol as there are the ones who did everything since 2017.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------
 

 
Conclusion:

I must confess that I used a "funny" tone to write this, it's dramatic enough as it is to make the drama even more dramatic.

No one care of my own feeling, but i will express it because this hurts me more than i want to admit.

It would have been so simple to be part of the team as they requested, to support the project you created back in 2017.

It's clear enough that you never expected Electra to succeed as it did. And you considered this... i don't know, like an experience?

But even if it was an simple experience for you, you were not allow to play with user money.

Think to that and about what you did...



Electra01 November 28, 2020, 10:11:16 PM
As I said before, I knew a malicious move was coming and acted preemptively and made initial position reductions without announcement but transparently.

http://electraexplorer.info/address/EeUZHkxP12NQtsZzDZZzzkQ76BM9PG8ZNL

The amount sent to the address you mention seems to be around 500 million unless I am reading it incorrectly. You are also not taking into account that large amounts of ECA was withdrawn from exchanges back to the public wallets and sent again a few days later. I definitely did not sell 500 million there. I did not at any point during this year control more than 900 million ECA pre-mine or stakes. Look at page 2 of this address if you want to see examples of ECA returning to the public wallets:

https://explorer.electraproject.org/address/EJXiQYb5tYjVdn8erLT92F6D5ZmCG2ZCvZ

While looking through the addresses to counter your argument I have actually come accross an anomaly. The wallet containing this address on my desktop has 0 ECA in it but for some reason it says 16,000 ECA in the block explorer. I will look into this.

The other arguments you make are generally about what the team did versus me. They did do a lot. I never said I did all the work and gave credit as much as possible but I also made important contributions and major sacrifices for this project. If some people want to start all over and pursue a new direction it is their choice.

Hi E01 - it is hard for the community to know who is right or wrong. However - what is 100% wrong is people who stored their eca on mobile and exchanges are deemed as unloyal and wont receive the ecap airdrop.

Can you please advise your intention for eca? You will still have a strong following - ECA will always be the original and main chain. Let us know if you will persists with eca and we the community will support it.

hmmmm EcaForgottenSupporters  "Date Registered:   Today at 10:25:05 PM

the mobile wallet will surely be eligible and the exchanges it is impossible since E01 is hiding on it and the goal of ECAP is to eliminate it to start again on a healthy basis
---------------------------

And for E01 =

lol you are really pathetic, why do you only answer that?

And you're lying again, no action would have been done without the massive sales on your personal account.

It's as if thief steals and as an excuse when caught = I stole because I knew the police were going to look for me
that does not make any sense

proof that we have acted urgently and that nothing is ready for ECAP!

When it comes to "the anomaly," you are the crypto's biggest noob. It is necessary to rescan because all the addresses have a few% of errors on the explorer.

Besides, take the opportunity to explore it, there will soon be more if you don't pay the servers.

the team never did anything against you, they could have hurt you and wouldn't have tried to talk to you trusting you.
And you dare "rogue" insults. Amazing !

it's very strange to see you so active now and to select the questions you want to answer.
When it took you days to come forward during the sales and you still hadn't answered the questions. (by being logged in every day to sell)

In conclusion again = YOU AVOID QUESTIONS and YOU ARE A SCAMMER

November 28, 2020, 10:40:08 PM
Yes I just registered an account as you guys keep saying to ask E01 directly on this forum. I dont have an account here so of course I have to register.

Regarding mobile - this is still being investigated and from the responses I've seen, it would also seem impossible due to technical constraints.

Hence we are the forgotten supporters.




Robofus November 28, 2020, 10:42:31 PM
no worries but I want to stress it. And again NO, we are still working on the mobile wallet, it is not guaranteed yet but we are postponing the airdrop to successfully include the mobile.

You can stay with E01 if you want, but he's now alone. 100% of the team switches to ECAP.

ps: can you tell us who you are on discord or telegram?



EcaForgottenSuppor November 28, 2020, 10:47:12 PM
Fair enough. Hope mobile works out for many of us.

We have spent lots of money investing in this coin so if we dont receive ecap then we have no choice but to support e01.

The ball is also in e01's court - does he want to continue? Please just end this once and for all.




Robofus
November 28, 2020, 11:18:46 PM	 #3243

Chances are we can make the mobile wallet eligible I think you will have a choice.   

if he wants to continue, he should already answer all of the questions on the previous page instead of trying to avoid them.

And your question is very interesting so I'm just waiting to see if he answers everything.

But I'm afraid he won't do anything for Electra like for years ... ECA will die if there are no more developers and he seeks war, there will be nothing left of ECA.

The website / explorer / mobile app / access ... if we were as bad as E01 says we can all cut and kill Electra by making it empty now. (already there is no longer any roadmap or developer)

The team was respectful in the announcement of the airdrop ECAP by suggesting that he continue if he wanted and he dares to insult "rogue", it could end badly if he continues this attack.


Electra01 November 29, 2020, 12:33:28 AM

I have sent all remaining funds that were promised for the project to the foundation. So the community and foundation can freely decide on how to operate the funds from now on and what objectives to pursue. The real question is if the foundation will decide to stay with ECA or not and it is something I am completely unsure about. If they do not stay with Electra, I do not know what they will do with the ECA funds. That is something they will have to answer and please do ask them because it will have an effect on which chain they decide to support. They will have more funds if they stay with Electra and lose half if they switch to ECAP but I am not sure if this is an important incentive for them of not. As far as the foundation tells me it will be around a week before they announce which chain they will support.


I am guessing the airdrop will happen because everyone loves free coins but to come to the level Electra already is at will take a lot of extra investment, work and time on their part and they will also start with less funding.

I am obviously sentimental towards ECA and if the foundation announces they are with the Electra project, it will have a good harmonious future that will include me as an advisor and contributor.  I am also very appreciative of the support you offer.



Electra01
November 29, 2020, 12:43:02 AM

PN2020
November 29, 2020, 12:50:48 AM
The team said they know that E01 still has about 1 billion ECA in private wallets, and they expect ECAP to have about 10 billion less supply after the airdrop. Here're my observations:

1) The team have intentionally planned to reduce supply by 10 billion at the expenses of people who have ECA on exchanges. That is their ultimate goal, not just to get rid of E01. The team also mentioned that E01 has about 50 million ECA in Cryptopia, which is a fraction of about 2 billion ECA that belong to many holders. Their justification is that it's technically impossible to airdrop to users who will receive ECA back from Cryptopia in the near future. The fact is Cryptopia keeps ECA in only a few accounts, and anyone can see them from the block explorer. If the team really don't know how to airdrop to users who will get their ECA back from Cryptopia, then how can anyone trust them to develop a crypto project?  

2) The team said that they know which private wallets belong to E01, so he won't be able to get ECAP airdrop.
- If they can really prevent E01 from getting airdrops from these accounts, why they need to exclude exchange accounts from the airdrop?
- If they can't, then what's the point of the airdrop because E01 will get ECAP airdrop anyway?

3) If E01 really has only 1 billion ECA left, what's a big deal? It's not unusual for a 30-billion supply project to have whales with 1 billion or more. It's crypto, and people dump all the time. Are they going to do another airdrop if they find out that someone has more than 1 billion ECAP in the future? For whatever conflicts the team have with E01, don't use it as an excuse to take away investment from those who also spent money to buy ECA.

4) The team said they airdrop ECAP for free, so people who have their ECA in exchange accounts won't lose anything. If you read in the discord, you will see that community members (who will benefit from the loss of others) and some of the team members are wishing ECA to disappear after the airdrop. The team is even taking away the social media and a lot of supporters from ECA. They know really well that their intention is to leave ECA project to die. People who trade ECA on exchanges accept the risk that exchanges may get hacked, but Coinfalcon doesn't get hacked and Cryptopia will return about 2 billion ECA to account holders in the near future. People are not losing their investment because of the malicious hack, but because of the team's decision to exclude exchange accounts from the airdrop. The malicious act in this case is indeed done by the team.

BTW, Don't tell me that the QT-wallet runners are more important than others. They run nodes because they get staking rewards that others don't.

If you got to social media that the team has total control, you will see a lot of flattering posts by those members who can't wait to benefit from the loss of others. For those members who complained about unfairness, they mostly have been banned, and their posts were removed. Just go to ECAP twitter account, you will see how people really feel about this airdrop. https://twitter.com/ElectracoinECA/status/1331917075682635776

Team members always say that they have worked for free. Most of them hold a lot of ECA, and they will benefit from the increase of coin value. Stop pretending to be the saviors. You guys are just upset because you haven't gotten compensated enough for what you guys have done.

******* For those who think about buying ECAP, please run away from it as you can. The ECAP SCAM will fail miserably because it has bad intention from the start. This project starts by stealing investment from innocent people in order to reduce the total supply. It will go nowhere and is a SCAM even before it starts. ********

WHAT A SHAME!

Robert McCall November 29, 2020, 04:28:31 AM




E01,

First and foremost, yes this is my first post; however, I have watched this project since 2017.

Secondly, with your sudden interest in responding and becoming increasingly more active, it has become quite apparent that you are either, 1.) worried or 2.) pissed off beyond any level you have ever experienced before. It could be both, yet you cannot contain your emotions which is causing you to slip up and make irrational statements, to which will allow all to piece this puzzle together. Until then just remember this; when you pray for rain, you've got to deal with the mud too.

Electra01 November 29, 2020, 05:48:50 AM
My activity has increased in response to the higher number of posts than usual and because it is a critical month for the project. I do try to remain objective in my responses but some emotion is likely to slip out from time to time. If you have the time, PM me which statements you considered irrational and I will try to reword them into a more rational state.

You have decided to answer only one selected question, it makes sense because you just can't say much on all of this.

About your answer on this only point, we say exactly the same thank you. We talk about sending huge amount of premine to exchange.

i advise everyone to read my first comment then the answer (both quoted above)  and get your own opinion on E01 capacities.

It's wonderful, you always avoid the most important questions and told that you are more active because of the increased activity.

Yet even when there was only one message, you did not reply.
You could have explained yourself before, (as long as it was possible to save ECA) instead of continuously selling the premine without answering.

Too late now.

November 29, 2020, 01:35:34 PM
You only sent a fraction of the total premind E01! Everyone knows the power of the blockchain:

CF exchange deposit address of E01, direct deposit from premine wallet: http://electraexplorer.info/address/EeUZHkxP12NQtsZzDZZzzkQ76BM9PG8ZNL

1,137,909,766 More than 1 billion but you send only 197 mil one day ago to the foundation?

This confirms that you are trying to be 'the good guy' but you arent!
Such a noob

Ps
Made a BT account specially just to reply for your crap on a beautiful Sunday!
Lmao




12dima12 November 29, 2020, 01:54:41 PM
E01 - let's assume the following scenario:

The foundation decides to give up the project and is dissolved. The funds held will be returned to you (the creator of the project).
What happens after that??
Will you lead the project as creators or do we have to assume that the project will be buried.
Please answer the question explicitly.

As we know, you acted out of premonition and sold Premine-Stake funds before anything happened.
Please state what happens to the currency you received for the sale?

What would happen to it if ECAP hadn't come about?

November 29, 2020, 03:12:33 PM
I have already replied to a similar statement made a few posts ago.


Electra01 November 29, 2020, 03:18:03 PM

If the foundation is dissolved and funds returned to me, then the project will go back to the initial objectives listed in the OP.

Premine is for the project, stakes are not. If ECAP hadn't come about this would have still been the case.



Robofus November 29, 2020, 03:31:50 PM
Why are you still ignoring the questions? It doesn't work in public and you prove to be a scammer and manipulator.

for example

why do you say that the stakes of the premine do not belong to the premine (and therefore to the foundation) when you said you should cover $ 1000 in 2017? and only need 100 million at this price (2017 price lol)  so why did you sell 700 million stakes for your personal account?

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1848351.msg21138302#msg21138302

Ps: if you take over the foundation you will have to show yourself publicly, don't forget that many people expect that from you   




Electra01 November 29, 2020, 04:35:57 PM
Funds returning to me from the foundation is unlikely.

Article   11    -    Dissolution

2.   After   dissolution,   the   foundation   will   remain   until   the   financial   balance   is   0.

5.   If   the   foundation   has   a   surplus   on   the   financial   balance,   the   remaining   finances   must   be   spent   on   the   sustainability   of   the   foundation   where   possible.

Robert McCall November 29, 2020, 09:00:46 PM
So do you anticipate carrying ECA forward, even if the foundation dissolves?



12dima12 November 29, 2020, 09:31:44 PM

It looks like the foundation will be dissolved and you as the founder will get the premine back if no new members are found.
https://twitter.com/ECA_Foundation/status/1333155433662590981?s=20

You say ECA will stick to the old goals.

Who will take care of the project?
Who will develop further?
Who will pay for and maintain the infrastructure?

I ask for a transparent contribution or you come online in Telegram / Discord to talk to the community in real time.

Allow me to quote some part of the ECA Foundation statement which you can find here: https://electrafoundation.medium.com/foundation-statement-with-regards-to-recent-developments-within-the-eca-project-b46be4a902f6

The statutes also state that all ECA members can apply to become a board member. If you are interested in this position, you can email us at foundation@electraproject.org . Please be aware that one of the criteria to become a board member is that physical identification at a Dutch notary is mandatory.

So I would like to see this project continue and than may compete with ECAP, would the best survive. I will hodl both.

And here we are, what had to happen happened.
I carried this project for over a year, during my disappointment I thought I could count on either the so-called community or at least on those who formed the foundation but unfortunately my hopes are quickly dashed, when E01 in the exchanges we had he literally despised me
While it is ECA, ECAP and maybe tomorrow another split an ECAP + I take no risk to say that the mass is done and still hundreds of investors who will be plucked
what a waste but we could expect better with this bunch of opportunists

Electra01
December 01, 2020, 12:56:11 AM
Forking Electra was a big priority. If the current code was hidden from me, the project would have died for sure.

I will pay for the new critical infrastructure if needed.

My initial objectives are almost finished. When they are, I will not have additional goals.

If new replacements are chosen in the foundation, I will very likely accept that they stay in charge of the funds. If the foundation is dissolved, I will use the funds to pay for the new infrasructure and complete the objectives. If any funds remain after the objectives are complete I will give a grace period of 6 months for a new foundation to be set up and if a new foundation is not set up I will assume the users are not interested to take the project further and will donate the rest of the pre-mine to charity and provide evidence of it.

So it seems like little progress is being made with regards to making things right for the investors. This feud between the two sides has left many investors with nothing and a project that has been stolen away from them. To claim that this other project is "new" is laughable, it is literally everything that ECA was and promised to be. It is simply a slight rebranding with everything else being the same.

There are options available to make the situation right and they know it, it is simply a matter of taking action.

As an investor, it is quite confusing having ECA and ECAP with the founder and team being divorced and so forth. It is best that the team create or rebrand ECAP into something different. If ECA continues to remain exist and people wants to buy ECAP, it may cause confusion, instead of buying ECAP, ended up buying ECA since it is still ELECTRA, ended up asking can it be swapped since it is still ELECTRA. Same goes for website flow people searching for ELECTRA and ELECTRA PROTOCOL, site visits that pops out automatically visiting the wrong site, just by searching ELECTRA. Moreover, not everyone is on social medias, upon seeing their investment on ECA plummet, the same thing people will be asking in the future as it is still ECA with a P, any problem coming from ELECTRA will still lead to ECAP.

The community and team needs to inject some creativity to rebrand into a fresh start, call for some submission, naming/logo, and the team should be the judges to decide as community tend to create different accounts and vote for it to get what they want, but the team is the one carrying the name seeking for partnerships etc, the team will decide which to carry, as long not sticking back to ELECTRA. I've seen projects that is doing very well after rebranding, leaving the past behind and moves forward. There are so many forks out there and the name totally changed, but technology is like continues to upgrade even better with different fork. Just leave the black history behind and move forward. This is going to be a long and dramatic argument as there is no transparency.

As for my investment in ECA, its all down the drain and I do not trust the market that could possibly be manipulated by the founder, E01. Since the team have been the ones that are doing most of the work up until now, it is best that you have full control over the brand/funds that you're looking in the future years to come. Was planning to integrate ELECTRAPAY for my company, but now looking at ELECTRA is just so traumatizing. Just let go of the name ELECTRA and put it in archive.


Electra01
December 01, 2020, 04:05:35 PM
The other side is welcome back anytime, but at this stage, from the attitude they are showing, I assume they will continue with ECAP and therefore I must ensure ECA is prepared for the transition which I anticipate will be smooth. The current ECA stakeholders should assume that the upgrade to v3.0 will not go ahead for ECA as it is now intellectual property of ECAP and so ECA will remain on the current chain. Investors should also assume that ElectraPay, which was an initiative of the former team, will not be supported for ECA in the near future unless an agreement is reached with the ECAP team.



Robofus
December 01, 2020, 04:16:06 PM
The team and the devs migrate everything that was planned to ECAP, so no electrapay for ECA but just for ECAP.

Regarding your roadmap, it's interesting because you haven't done anything since 2017. And if this roadmap has no other objectives which will be added in the future we can consider the ECA as dead.

If you want to escape after finishing your roadmap you could have participated more actively with motivated and passionate devs instead of selling and being quiet and doing nothing.

I will not stop repeating my last message until I have an answer (3rd time) =

why do you say that the stakes of the premine do not belong to the premine (and therefore to the foundation) when you said you should cover $ 1000 in 2017? and only need 100 million at this price (2017 price lol)  so why did you sell 700 million stakes for your personal account?

Electra01 December 01, 2020, 08:25:07 PM
I get your point and now understand where the issue is stemming from. The first sentence is poorly worded. The word capital is very general. It is wrong to assume only financial capital. Other capital types that may apply are: individual capital and intellectual capital along with others.

Investment also has multiple definitions:
The action or process of investing money for profit.
An act of devoting time, effort, or energy to a particular undertaking with the expectation of a worthwhile result.

I invested a lot of my individual, financial and intellectual capital into the project for the past four years. The stakes compensate me for this.







IcathTrade
December 01, 2020, 08:42:05 PM
The only thing you did is spend the premine when you have accepted to.

You paid 0 server, you paid 0 website, you didn't participate to the calls, you didn't participate to the project management at all.

individual / financial / intellectual, how dare you?

you were not active at all, how dare you say this?

Asmoth, Master Den, Ruru, Jenova, Nashclay, Greg, Robert, Bob and others

These guys did all what exist today in Electra, they are the ones who made Electra a known brand.

They are the only one



Robofus
December 01, 2020, 09:19:34 PM
This answer is such a joke ...
you haven't done anything ... you haven't updated your weebly website roadmap since 2017.

You have no intellectual or blockchain knowledge.

You only think about your profit without ever participate to the project, you were really totally useless financially, intellectually and individually.

you simply take advantage of the naivety of the users to dump on them.

it is for this reason that I ask you to find a solution to resolve this issue and return all stolen BTC / altcoins to the community. -> you can send me a private message if you are really looking for a solution.

Eren this is your last chance, as you said you are not unknown. Otherwise then when certain things are done, there is no return.
I hope you take me seriously and realize the bad things you have done

December 01, 2020, 11:03:25 PM
Dude you don't have a clue either. This ECA team who were earlier considered white knights are a bunch of scammers who are trying to profit on the expenses of several users who had their wallets locked in Cryptopia. That is very dirty way to suddenly drive the price of you ECAP token 300% just excluding 2bi coins just on topia, calling all holdrs 'fuckin' traders who want to dump ECA and banning everyone who dares to complain on ECA's channels. ECAP or whatever name you those guys decide to call it already born very bad. That's an abort.


Robofus
You pretending to be someone you're not (Aman) and with an account that has just been created = Date Registered:Today at 10:52:58 PM
Exchanges cannot be eligible due to Eren / E01 hidden there. For cryptopia, you may never get your ECA back with the cost of liquidation.
If you deposit everything you own on an exchange it's a risk, and I'm sorry for you.

Otherwise, the volunteers have no advantage in excluding the community, we could very well give up everything for everyone (for example create a new project from 0 with an ICO and without airdrop).
And unlike Eren, we never steal or manipulate.

Aman Sin
December 02, 2020, 12:09:28 AM
1) I am not pretending to be anyone and I am not aware about any other Aman Sin here.
2) I cant understand the issue on creating an account today. I can do it again tomorrow and so on since ECA's team are banning from channels on the first complain from exchange holders.
3) The coins on Cryptopia are fully returning to its owners without costs. Yes, billion of ECA will be useless due the team blocking it from the airdrop.
4) You dont need to say sorry about topia. My coins are there. They were not hacked. They will return in this very coming months. It better to say sorry about team decision. Ironically.
5) Yes, the team and indirectly, the owners have a lot of advantage excluding billions of ECA stored in exchanges, decreasing supply and increasing ECAP value. Its not magic.
6) I am even not retard to respond about your last issue. Or maybe I should respond; go on lets see what happens, what kind o credibility  these names could have just giving up from this project...The truth is team hide themselves behind this 'doing it for free' mask while everyone knows most of them are bonanza whales. C'mon, man up!



Robofus
December 02, 2020, 09:36:28 AM
1= There is already an Aman singh, hence my remark.
2= you could have registered here since 2017, and here you will never be banned.
3= the ECA do not change, if E01 who is the founder of the project continues you can work with him.
4= If you're sure to get them back you should be happy. Nothing changes for ECA, just volunteers cannot continue with work E01. But E01 can continue with other people.
5= what you said is wrong, if that was what we wanted we have more to gain from doing an ICO since 0 and no airdrop.
6= how can you say that the team are bonenza whales when 100% of the team, except me, arrived months after the bonenza ?

The only person who abandoned the project is the person responsible for the destruction -> Eren / E01, you can check his activities on bitcointalk and you will see that he was never there except to thank the volunteers once a year. And he never answered questions when it mattered -> as I proved in a screenshot a few pages before.

And as you can see I am not in the ECA project anymore but I am more active than Eren on this topic. You should be asking yourself the right questions if you're not a troll.

December 02, 2020, 01:37:59 PM
VERY IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT

Dear Stakeholders,

The servers controlled by former team member Jenova contain the seed nodes for Ellipal, the mobile wallets and support ElectraPay and all third-party wallets. They will be SHUT DOWN PERMENANTLY in a few days/hours (I have not been given a specific date as of yet) which means ECA in mobile wallets and Ellipal will FREEZE unless you convince him to re-open the servers for you. He did kindly offer to keep servers running for 0.2 BTC/month but I have concluded that 2.4 BTC/year would be an unsustainable cost for the ECA project and therefore service for Ellipal, mobile wallets, ElectraPay and all third-party wallets will be discontinued the moment servers are cut. Desktop and exchange wallets WILL still function as far as I am told by Jenova.

He is generously keeping the servers open for the time being so users do not have their ECA frozen but I recommend you to WITHDRAW your ECA to a desktop or an exchange wallet AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. After server support is cut DO NOT send any ECA to Ellipal or mobile wallets. Desktop and exchange wallets will be the best places to keep your ECA at this point.

What remains is the block explorer and website. I will continue them but I am deciding whether to maintain the current ones on Jenova's servers or create new ones to host personally. You will be informed further as soon as I decide.

Please SHARE this message with as many users as possible. I will also ask the ECAP team to share this and hopefully they will. I want all ECA holders to read this message. I do not want anyone left behind. Therefore, the Bitcointalk thread will be locked for the next 3 days to ensure as many people see this message as possible without the clutter of additional messages. If you have any queries PM me in Bitcointalk and I will get back to you.


Robert McCall December 06, 2020, 05:56:41 AM

Wow, what crap. Do you actually believe yourself that you are smart and had good reasons for your actions as you tried to explain? The text above shows clearly you have a ego-problem and take yourself too serious. Sadly you had a powerful toy in your hands to literally burn lots of money for lots of people including me. This action has been beyond stupid, especially considering the current crypto market situation (and that crypto gains usually go from big- to small-caps in a cycle) and that the team accomplished a few nice things over the last years and managed to turn the project around to be at least externally perceived as kind of legit instead of scam - basically the basis for more good things to come for investors, even for you, if you would have been more considerate and less ego-driven.

With all respect: f+ck you for f+cking me over and even feel righteous with this kindergarten explanation above.

Electra01 December 07, 2020, 07:21:01 PM

Dear Stakeholders,

As block explorers hosted by Jenova will close soon I have had a new one made to ensure a better transition.

https://eca.ccore.online/connections
A new website is also in the pipeline.

I also reject all accusations made against me repetitively by the same 3 people and hope Robert McCall sends me 5,000,000 ECA he has promised in the post above. I am sure he is aware of my addresses.




Robert McCall December 07, 2020, 07:50:59 PM
Damn he did ... but just like him, I'm not a man of my word, plus that 5M are from staked coins from a wallet that I dumped so what is remaining is rightfully mine.


AltInvestor2018December 07, 2020, 08:46:20 PM
Anybody who trusts the team and supports ECAP is either insane or completely stupid. 
They're starting off their "new" coin by stealing the assets of ECA.
As much as E01 dumping HIS coin (yes, his... Robert was very clear that this was a known factor back in 2018... read back through the posts in July of 2018) was horrible and hurt everyone's values,  at least he didn't steal anything belonging to anyone else.  He's always been open about the fact that the staking on the premine was his.  It would be more commonly known if the Team hadn't accused everyone of FUD and belittled everyone who ever brought it up. 
There's been multiple big sells over the years,  but for some reason the Team decided with this one to quit and start their own,  conveniently eliminating a whole bunch of the community from their planned airdrop,  while using the community as justification to out and out steal assets from ECA.
The Foundation Board, who constantly and continuously advertised how much safer and more official the Foundation made ECA, are actively & openly participating in this espionage.
And while they're openly stealing assets and hurting people,  they're saying "trust us... again". Oh, and can't forget everyone just has to "trust" that none of the team sold anything.  I guess we're also just supposed to "trust" that none of them moved their coins from an exchange to their wallet before the snapshot was taken.  If the team wants trust they should provide their wallet addresses so everyone can go through their transactions,  just like they demand of E01. Yeah,  it's private... but so are the stakes they're screaming about that E01 sold.  How do we know that none of them were doing exactly the same thing?
Even without all the reasoning from E01, the Team's excuses stink. It's pretty obviously just a way to give themselves a bigger premine for expenses and lower the coin supply by however many poor victims have coins on an exchange.
E01...I have no respect for how you chose to sell your ECA, but that was and always has been an option available to you.  It was a despicable move,  but not blatantly dishonest. 
The Team & the Foundation though... blatantly dishonest.  I'm surprised there's nothing written into the Foundation about espionage by Board members.

It is what it is ,


      I made a shittonne of money from this project ...... the 24 hour mining bonanza..... ....I rented hash on nicehash for it .

       I lived comfortably off electra for 2 years , literally ..... it all went to shit in the end but I had close to 1 billion coins from 1 day of mining (I live in a 1 bedroom flat , I had 3 rigs of my own only) , then the stake rewards were amazing . Eca coins peaked hard at round 50 sats mid 2018 .

   It was obvious it wasn't gonna last , it was too good to be true for some people .
  
     I had nothing to do with the project , I was just a miner who liked the idea of the bonanza , and fuck yes it was worth it .

    Sorry to see it go this way but Massive thanks to the electra project for changing my life <3



       Nothing really surprises me in the crypto space anymore , might be the time to buy eca , at 1/10th of a satoshi , surley it can only go up again , I sold all but 6 million coins before this happened , sold my last batches at 1.3 sats , Im buying some back for less than 10% of what i sold the last for . Investing based on pure maths , whats to say all this isnt just a scam?

        Drop value of current eca coin with fud for accumulation , before pumping it again , and in the process get a whole new coin out of it . good deal lol .

Well - as long as nobody is going to pick up the project, it can't go far... the Team that was formed out of a supporting community has left to a new coin called electra protocol with the ticker XEP

The original founder was not very active for a long time

So - who is going to go forward with it... without active people - no way to the moon..,




Electra01
January 14, 2021, 08:13:36 PM
In my experience, for an altcoin to truly die or be close to death one of the following must happen:
1)   No one mining/staking so the blockchain stops.
2)   Consistently 0 USD daily volume or getting delisted from all exchanges/Coinmarketcap.
3)   A big error in the code that no one bothers to fix.
4)   Cease and desist orders from the USA targeting a specific altcoin.
5)   Source code and wallet downloads becoming inaccessible to users.

As long as these do not happen the project will be alive. The first year Electra was founded we came close to 1, 2 and 3 but remained alive nonetheless and on top of that, for reasons still unknown to me, pumped 500x in a month. Some people consider code updates necessary for the survival of a coin but there are successful coins out there like Dogecoin that do not update the code frequently. Electra's code is unique among altcoins due to the consensus mechanism that does not exist in any other project.

Bear in mind, competition is much fiercer. When Electra was created there were around 700 coins and now there are 10,000+. Many with 10,000,000 USD+ budgets! Time will tell how Electra will fare. For me Electra is in the same league as Blackcoin, Peercoin, Litecoin, Maxcoin, Icebergcoin and Boolberry etc. The league of 2nd generation Bitcoin based altcoins with one or more unique features. Some have obviously fared better than others.

So if that is done, you should send from Ellipal to the ECA wallet address you generate in the ECA wallet.

And I do not how to do now.

I install ECA wallet to desktop, I unblock wallet, I Click Tools -- Debug Window/Console, I Click on the Console tab

As said before...you are looking on instructions from Electraprotocol..this is XEP coin. something completely different.
You need to go to electraproject.org and check there for ECA related issues. Or contact the owner of ECA..E01

Well, although you took your information from the electraprotocol website, they seem correct as well for Electra...

What I'dont know, as I never used Ellipal, is in what way you have been able to extract the private key... If you enter a correct ECA private Key in to an Electra-wallet, it should show in the selection of wallets for deposits (the address should show) - if it doesn't match, there must be something wrong with your private key. OR you might check with the Explorer if the coins are still on that address...

Dear E01,

My eca's are stuck on my mobile wallet and I cannot send them to all desktop or exchange.

Could you please help solving this problem
Making the mobile wallets work again.

Thanks in advance!

Hello
You are lucky. My coins stuck in blockchain and nobody help me. Keep calm and search.
I try to solve my problem and nobody help me and not understand why.
I don't know why I think the XEP project will go to zero and the ECA project will last over time if the team is rebuilt.
Probably our problems will be solved when the team is rebuilt and we will have more support.
I say wait and be patient. I don't know why I believe in this project but that's how I feel.


GoodHabit

Well, there are very few people here, so even if someone has some knowledge, it will take time until your problem will be noticed...

I don't actually get what you mean with "stuck in blockchain"... since your last question I looked up the webpage of Ellipal, and if I understood correctly, they don't actually offer an option to extract your private key.. IF you really have your private key, it should be a 52character word starting wit Qq...... - if you have something different, it's not your Electra private key,.
If it IS, however, than you should be able to import it in to your Electra-Core wallet.

BTW, ECA is still listed on Ellipals website as supported...so it is a problem between you and Ellipal, - either they have to make their App again working on the Electra blockchain, or they have to provide a way to extract your private key.... - So, my tip - contact Ellipal support...

Hello,
First I want to write all story in detail.
I buy Electra from exchange in 2 transactions.
Also, after that I send to my ECA account from Ellipal.
After that Ellipal block all ECA account.
After Ellipal block all ECA acoount I write to Ellipal and with help from Ellipal I extract from my device Private Key.
So, in this moment I have Private Key (and Private Key start with Qq...... and have 54 characters) and adress of my Eca wallet.
I say "my coins stuck in blockchain" !.
Yes, I see my coins because I verify transactions and coins is now in my ECA wallet. So, my coins is in my wallet (Ellipal wallet) but my wallet is block.
In this moment ECA Ellipal wallet show 0 coins. But coins is in my ECA wallet if I search after adress on https://eca.ccore.online/

After that I ask on Discord, Telegram, Reddit (Reddit do not post my questions), I write to ECA, I write to Ellipal and all say to me to install ECA desktop wallet and follow steps from this link:

https://learn.electraprotocol.com/docs/paper_import/

Note:
I install ECA desktop wallet
I sync ECA desktop wallet
I use command like in link https://learn.electraprotocol.com/docs/paper_import/
And I can not import my coins.

After that I write to ECA (EC01 from here) and I receive this message:

"Firstly make sure the desktop wallet is fully synced.
Electra no longer supports Ellipal wallet as you have probably found out. The Ellipal app holds your coins so it is Ellipal's responsibility to help you on this. Have you tried contacting them and asking how you can import the Ellipal private keys to your ECA wallet? I have never imported a private key from Ellipal myself so can only provide limited advice.
Downloading the desktop wallet and typing in the console were right moves but there may be another command that needs to be written and only Ellipal can tell you this.
Electra is Bitcoin based so commands are the same as they are for Bitcoin. I have shared the link to their guide on importing private keys:
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/How_to_import_private_keys"

After this message I write to Ellipal and Ellipal write me this message:
"Hello there,
You can go to the app, and import an account with mnemonics and pass phrase, after that you will get a hot wallet account;
And then go to the account settings, export the private keys, choose ECA.
And import the private key on an exchange/ a wallet that support ECA coin"

From this I block and I do not how to do to recover my coins.

So, in my ECA desktop wallet do not work to import follow step from link https://learn.electraprotocol.com/docs/paper_import/, in exchange (like say Ellipal), I don't know how can do this and what exchange accept this type of transactions.
Another method like say EC01 (Downloading the desktop wallet and typing in the console were right moves but there may be another command that needs to be written and only Ellipal can tell you this. Electra is Bitcoin based so commands are the same as they are for Bitcoin. I have shared the link to their guide on importing private keys: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/How_to_import_private_keys") I not understand how can do that.

In finaly what can do now?
I wait to somebody help me if know how to solve the problem.




GoodHabit
January 22, 2021, 06:40:28 PM
Well, the question I see here is - could you use the process that you received from the Ellipal support (as this was the method to get the private key?) If yes, importing should work, if it doesn't - it's either the wrong key - as you did something wrong - OR - there are multiple keys, and you would have to check  / try which one is for the address that holds your coins. OR the process described by Ellipal doesn't work, so - again, you would have to check with their support....

OTOH, As far as I understand the Ellipal manual, you could also enter your mnemonic in to the mobile ECA-wallet, and this would work IF - and thats the BIG IF - those will ever work again....

Hello
I trust Ellipal and I have a good Private Key I m sure for that (99.999999%).
Yes I discover Private Key with Ellipal support (Ellipal support answer me only on email in maximum 20 hrs).
Probably I think for ECA support is hard to answer and solve problems in a short time for holders probably until he solves the problems with those who left the team.
By the way, I believe in the electra project in this phase and I hope to solve my problem as soon as possible.

What I can't understand at the moment is why the team left and left a project that had everything it needed to climb to the top. I think the electra manager is in a difficult situation at the moment. It's just my point of view right now. I don't know why but I have more confidence in the electra project than in the new XEP project at the moment.
Thanks for all for the moment.

Hello again
In syntax from here:

importprivkey Qq............................. "labelofAddress"

What can write at "labelofAddress" ?
If put XXXXXX for example

Return error

Error: Please enter the wallet passphrase with walletpassphrase first. (code -13)

Probably I write something wrong ?
Thanks

Let me know the result. Also many thanks to GoodHabit for helping out.






DK1122 January 23, 2021, 10:47:33 AM
Hello Electra01 and GoodHabit,
Thanks for all.
Working.

So, I write this how I do.

I start ECA desktop wallet.
I sync the wallet.
I go to Settings -> Unlock wallet
I go to Tools-> Debug console
In Console I write first: walletpassphrase "my password for unlock the wallet" 600
Note: I write my password with " "
I hit Enter
After I write: importprivkey "my Private Key" "labelofAddress"
Note: I write my Private Key without " " and the label of adress with "  "
I hit Enter
And after 1 minute all my coins is in my wallet.

Thank you very much guys.

I ask on Discord, Telegram etc and nobody tell me how to do exactly. I leave this here for help who need.

PS
Electra01 go with this project to the moon !
Don't give up !

ANNOUNCEMENTS/COMMENTS/THOUGHTS/REVIEW


I have tried to convince the Electra foundation to stay open for now and all ECA funds are still there ready for anyone from the ECA community to control if they apply as board members. Any user interested in applying to the foundation is welcome to and will have to travel to the Netherlands to complete the process. I will aim to keep it open until around August but how long it stays open also depends on the mercy of the former board members.


As I have written many times before, Electra is a decentralized project. This has benefits but also consequences. The "Electra project" Github page was owned by members of the current XEP/former ECA team. I found out today that the page including all source code, wallets, and whitepaper have been deleted. Luckily, I anticipated this risk and migrated/backed-up all of this to the former original Electra Github page a few weeks ago. The OP in this thread contains all updated links for the wallets, source code and whitepaper. CMC links will be updated in the coming days. I have also been forced to hastily create a new website as the old one also belongs to a former team member who has decided to delete all content on the website (I was warned about that beforehand at least). The new Electra website is humble but does the job and is safer than a conventional website: electracore.weebly.com


I condemn these hostile moves by the XEP team (even though there ARE also certain people in the XEP team I consider decent and have no issues who are always welcome back in ECA). The pages were deleted without informing me and had I not backed these up, ECA would have been dead and everyone's holdings doomed. This is one of the lowest acts I have seen in the cryptocurrency sector. They need to remember that a lot of people who got the XEP airdrop also still own ECA and attempts to sabotage ECA hurts both XEP (their own community) and ECA holders. The XEP team has again demonstrated publically that they use the word "community" for marketing only and not in actuality. They are willing to damage and destroy the holdings of multiple communities and users for negative feelings they harbor for one person. That Github page was maintenance free so to take the effort to log in there and delete it is not a cost-saving act but a malicious one. I have never in my life seen people delete source code to sabotage all holders of a specific coin. As said in the previous paragraph, I luckily backed it up and released it in the OP.


I have looked at the XEP block explorer and block 1 and have strong opinions on the distribution method and invite everyone to look at it also and do their own due diligence. If you want to invest in/HODL a coin where certain/all team members have a track record of abandoning projects/investors, losing users' funds, lying,  blackmail, deleting source code, wallets and critical users' comments, then XEP is a good choice. XEP was 100% pre-mined and has more pre-mine and total supply than ECA ever had. All pre-mine is again controlled by one person who is also currently deciding who gets an airdrop and who doesn't. I believe everyone who applied will get the airdrop but there is also a risk certain team members will get a lot more XEP than their original ECA holdings because it will be easy to mask. It depends on how the person in charge of the 27,000,000,000 XEP distributes it. I suggest all to watch that number closely as it is an intimidating amount. After the 27,000,000,000, there is also an additional 3 billion pre-mine that is held by one person and it is already fully mined. On the XEP rich list it says it will come in 2022, 2023 etc. but it is already out and ready to use. After the airdrop is distributed, assuming the unclaimed amount is burned accurately, I estimate their pre-mine will account for approximately 25%+ of the total supply. This whole ECA/XEP drama began over 200,000,000 ECA and the "ethical" solution the team has offered is 3,000,000,000 pre-mined XEP + a 27 billion pre-mine that can be airdropped/distributed manually however THEY want. Congratulations to everyone who will get the airdrop, you will make money wherever the price goes because you had no entry cost.  I won't go as far as speculating on my predicted price but I would rather bet on a horse race than buy XEP at the IEO price.


DK1122 anuary 23, 2021, 05:13:11 PM
Hello Electra01

Electra01 please go ahead with the Electra (ECA) project. I have personally studied and talked to several people about XEP and it seems to be a big scam. I personally believe in the Electra project and I assume that you have big problems with the continuation of the project at this moment until everything is set up as it was until some time ago. A saying goes that whoever betrays once will do it a second time. My opinion is to stop looking back and move forward as fast as you can and put everything back together so that you can continue the Electra project. Personally, I think you will succeed. We're moving forward with you. God help!


By the way, today after I finally managed to retrieve the coins and have them in my desktop wallet I managed to do PoS but that stopped at one point displaying in the lower right corner the message "Stacking is not active, Multisend Active" .
Is it the error considering what happened?
Does Stacking have anything to do with what's going on?
Because if so, this has to do with the bad things that the XEP team does, it seems to me the lowest thing.
I'm just asking!

Thanks!

You foolish scammer.

Sneaky dumping the premind.... YOU E01 could be the nakamoto of ECA but noo...you choose the other way to grab a few xxx winnings for your own benefits across the back of the best, hard working team you ever crossed. Eren Ö, you made the the wrong decision and the community feels your pain. No one wants your foundation lol get over with!

C'mon E01! You definitely don't need those people. They still dare to call it a 'community' project but they are profiting on the back of every single owner who can not get the airdrop. Scumbags! Total scumbags! During all this time playing the good guys full of moral values lol. More and more people starting to realize how dirty they are.

Just think about the fact that you bought them from E01, as he might have been selling his ECA all along the 3 years, to finally dump the premine, instead of supporting the foundation. E01 is really thankful to you.
Hope you applied for the Airdrop.

E01 will just drag this out like he did with his promise to send the remainder of the premine to the Foundation, which never happened! All the time dumping ECA to buy back lower as he always has done, well congratulations you got your wish, you can buy as much as you like, now that it's worth next to nothing, I hope you are happy with your last 4 years efforts.
Anyone hoping that this habitual liar will resurrect ECA project is going to be sorely disappointed.

Thank you for title. Announcements from XEP team sounds much more professional.

I am really wondering who you tried to convince, and how ?

You anticipated nothing. You have been warned enough in advance. You took the right action to backup the data.

ECA would have been dead and everyone's holdings doomed => Even if you say ECA is not dead, ECA's holding are worthless. Fortunately, XEP Airdrop is the right alternative, and permit to do not take into consideration anymore the holdings of ECA. (anyway, if by any matter, ECA recovers, it will be a chance for ECA holders who also took advantage of XEP.)
This is one of the lowest acts I have seen in the cryptocurrency sector. => you dumped premine, come on !!!! you dumped ECA since 3 years. WoW!
You have the source code, juste create another github page, upload it, and stop crying.

Laughing Out Loud (LOL)   
I think point of view isn't the same: XEP project is not abandoned, but continues. ECA seems to be abandoned (by its founder anyway...)
Where is the problem with XEP is 100% premined, as it will have maybe the best distribution a crypto ever had ?

Again, do you really one person controls the premine ? I am 99.99% the premine is multisig. Hope XEP team will announce it (or I might have missed it). XEP learned a lot with you, they will not reproduce the same mistakes.

That is true. I do not know why you keep saying "one person". There are more that 1 person performing the checks regarding the airdrop. And I personaly believe in them. (unlike in you).

False. multi-sig. Not held by one person! LOL.

Again LOL. There is already an estimate of the new distribution, and you are far from that ratio. I am just wondering how you estimating your numbers, without concrete information. Nevertheless, just wait beginning of Feb to have the final numbers.

The 100M XEP 5 sat has been eat.
ECA is now traded 0.04 sat on hitBTC.
Moreover, there is something far more annoying that the 200M drama you are mentioning... your ethical behavior.

Good afternoon! in the Electra wallet, it is written that "5 Days are behind" in the Scan Block, that is, the network has closed, how can I turn it on or resume?)


GoodHabit
January 24, 2021, 12:32:36 PM
You still have this problem? because 5 days behind only means that your wallet is not fully synced.. So you do have actual connections? If you don't, you might try the "addnode" xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx "add" comand, using addresses from the explorer...

January 24, 2021, 05:16:36 PM
Glad to see that your problem was solved, although I would never have suggested that you need to unlock your wallet before importing your private key, because that seemed to obvious...

The rather more interesting question is "How did you get your private key" from Ellipal

(I'm actually only asking out of technical curiosity, because I have neither coins on Ellipal nor on a Electra-mobile App - but may be a solution could be of interest to people who have their coins stuck on Mobile Electra wallets, unless / until they come (eventually) online once again....)

I know that Coinomi offers a link to a tool that allows to extract private keys, if you only know the Mnemonic... Tried this with the Mnemonic from my (empty) Android Electra wallet. Now, the tools supports many coins, but not explicitly Electra... So I looked if from Adress-Format / Private Key Format another coin would come very close...  Indeed, the result for EINSTEINIUM looked like an Electra address (both address format AND Private-Key-Format). But - unfortunately - I couldn't find my ECA-Address from the mobile wallet on that list... - although I could import that private key in to the Electra-wallet, and it was accepted as belonging to the same Address as on the list, so the format (including formula for private-Key/Address generation) seems to be identic between ECA and Einsteinium...

So, the question, how to extract a private key from Ellipal - just for fun, I donwloaded the Ellipal app as well, insertet the same Mnemonic, selected ECA as Coin, and received an address (but, unfortunaltely, again not the same as on my Mobile-Electra wallet). And, of course, I couldn't find any information in the Ellipal App OR on the Ellipal webpage how to get the private-key for that address...

So, the question, how did you get your correct Electra-private key out of Ellipal might really be of interest to several Electra-Holders with coins on their mobile wallet...

I write in this post (I think) how extract Private Key from Ellipal.
I have this problem I solve with Ellipal team on email (max 20 hours to respond on email).

Well
Open Ellipal app on the phone.
Go to my account.
Add account.
Use Mnemonic words.
Rename "Old account" with "Old account new".
In "Old account" color of screen was blue. In new account color of screen is orange.
Go to Profile.
Go to Manage account.
Go to new wallet.
And there you have Private Key, Keystore, Key.
I hope to help.
If it is necesary I write here my corespondence with Ellipal team.

Enjoy

Exporting private Keys from Ellipal works o.k - but unfortunately not from Electra-Mobile-wallet

I've been a bit to lazy to look true all options on the Ellipal-App, but with the Instructions in the post just above, extracting a private Key-from an Electra-Address on Ellipal, and importing it into the Electra-Core-wallet, works just fine...

(As most informations about using Mnemonic codes stipulate, that Mnemonics of the same length should work on all Devices using Mnemonic codes - so that you just could use any other app that supports your specific coin and restore your wallet using the Mnemonic - and Ellipal states this expressively on its web-page- I was hopeful that the Ellipal App might provide a solution for the users of the Electra-Mobile wallets, as the Ellipal app allows you to export your private Keys (create a paper-wallet), while the Electra-App doesn't - (or I have been unable to find out how, and as their is no support).)

But, unfortunately, using the same Mnemonic on the Electra-App and the Ellipal App doesn't produce the same address, so you CAN'T restore the coins on your Electra-Mobile-wallet on the Ellipal-App..

How can this be? The only explanation is that the Electra-App uses a non-standart procedure to generate addresses from the Mnemonic. If this is really the case, launching an App that doesn't allow to extract private keys was always a bad idea... - and in that case, ending server support on a rather short notice is even worse....










DK1122 January 25, 2021, 12:47:41 PM
Hello

Yes, I wrote about Ellipal. It is somehow normal that it is not the same private key that corresponds from Ellipal to the one from the Electra application (mobile wallet). There are two different applications though. I hope the post is ok and helps you. It took me a while to do this and now I'm done. I hope to help others.




GoodHabit
January 25, 2021, 02:32:46 PM	 #3333

Well, it's actually not normal... because all information about using Mnemonics always states that whatever the app - all mnemonics of a certain length (and with the same base language) should always produce the same root key, and from there, derrive the same privatekeys and wallet.addresses... (Ellipal explicitly states that it can be restored on any other device using the standard format for mnemonics...)

I'm not actually looking for help for myself, because I never held ECA on mobile Electra wallet or Ellipal... - I was just wondering / trying to help, because I did read a lot about people frustrated by the fact that the mobile Electra wallet isn't supported anymore, and therefore looking for a solution....

But Thank you anyhow...

Just wanted to say that ECA is available in AtomicDEX https://atomicdex.io, both mobile and desktop version, so you have a wallet with an integrated atomic swap DEX.
