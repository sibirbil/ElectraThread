your website doesnt have a domain youre using a weebly are you serious or just testing the crypto community for how little thought you can put into a scam a domain costs

not open bounty dev
maybe open bounty translation signature campaign facebook campaign and twitter campaign
if you need indonesian translation i can work for you to translate indonesian language

electra
march pm


i believe that free hosting is best hosting the website will never need to be reNNOed and always be available for the community to get information about electra i believe using a weebly domain has no correlation with scamming it is not my intent to scam the crypto community as you will see the day the source code is released on april 

i have come across many altcoin with very professional websites that have shut down there are even some active altcoin listed on coinmarketcap that no longer maintain websites

i like the algo but billion premine and day before the real reward would be scary if its entering the market at the first day

in which time zone is it aprilnd

some place is still st april


amy 
march pm
nsit algorithm recently appeared more may be very good i do not understand mining but would like to try to try 


miramare 
march pm
no worry about it

can any fool buy the coin in the first day

anyway how do you plan to use the premine dev any plan


electra 
march pm

i can guarantee that the eca wont enter the market before the real reward putting the premine on the market would be a very bad strategy on my part and would kill electra before it even reaches the super rewards bonanza stage if you are skeptical you are free to wait and come to mine later when the real reward kicks in


the premine will be used for but not limited to projects that improve accessibility reliability and usage of electra a summary of them can be found in the op listed under objectives

electra 
march pm

i have clearly stated this in the op

current planned launch date is april am gmt london time


electra 
march pm

i prepared a mining guide for NNOcomers it has some information omitted until launch day you can find the guide here

httpelectraprojectweeblycomgettingstartedhtml

the guide is meant for windows

there will be wallets available for both windows and linux the guide is only meant for windows

premine is a lot not ico if you have great concepts to deliver ico could be better your project is soso i think no ico is acceptable

electra 
march pm

no ico is planned

xlcus 
march pm

so what do you plan for the premine
any bounties


benjy
march pm

plan to dump and leave with btc

electra
march pm

the premine will be used for but not limited to projects that improve accessibility reliability and usage of electra a summary of them can be found in the op listed under objectives


there are no bounties planned in the initial stage of electra i will consider bounties after pos begins

electra
march pm

i believe this guy may be attempting to try to discourage others to mine electra so he can claim a larger portion of the super rewards bonanza for himself there will be many more like him the status of the premine can be easily tracked at anytime in electras block explorer

dump and leave with btc is not part of my plans

benjy 
march pm

im not interested in your coin shit but alert the others of the scam youre doing here you can put the whole premine in the ass

benjy
march pm

good luck with your easy money

no bounties yet but i will let you know if i require your services in the future

great thanks
ayers

lol is this a joke or what the premine is huge and the marketcap also billions while the reward is a fraction of i was expecting a rare coin here with that block reward instead im disappointed by the greedy dev that we have here at least make that pos give us super reward or something because this look like a scam
electra
april pm

i see your point as i predicted there will be uncertainty and tension between myself and potential miners for the first day and i understand that i believe though that trust will increase every day i do not sell the premine and when close to the super rewards bonanza there will be a lot more participants my reasons for the low block rewards during the first day are clearly stated in the op you also seem to have missed the fact that close to billion electra will be pow mined in hours on day reducing the share of the premine to about of the billion eca that will exist at that point


electra
april am
wallets ports and source code are released happy mining

itismoneyme
april am

mined blocks and got eca this is enough for me in following day i am out
dear dev i think youll have hash rate problem in this day period because eca per block is not worth it to point miners to this coin 
farsky
april am

help please
if i use router do i must throw a port on my router i do not know how it will be in english
i ran it on your instructions it seems to work
i used to read that without redefining the port of the router my solo coin will not be written to the common blockchain

itismoneyme
april am

i didnt change my router configurations and i used ccminerrc for solo mining
this is the electraconf file

radiera
april am

how to mine it can use cpu 


cpuminermultirel i cant use it

octavarium
april am

any pool 

electra
april am

i think you were the first person to start mining when difficulty was only at so you got quite a lot of blocks difficulty is going up and has reached so the hash rate is increasing

also thanks for helping farsky with his mining

electra
april am

i got pmed for a pool which is now being developed ill announce when it is ready if there is anyone else who wants to make a pool feel free to do so

qiwoman

what a shame this coin will only benefit the developer and miners and there is nothing else for any of us other members of the crypto community i do wish you luck though and its a shame i dont mine yet maybe i should eventually start mining some coin too

electra
april am
i did not test it with any cpu miners i have a gpu solo mining guide here


farsky
april am
yes everything works thanks 
but i do not understand how
before i did unsuccessfully to solomine this is the first coin 
and i did not change the router settings

do should my balance be displayed in the blockexplorer 
it is written

itismoneyme
april am

 confirmations are required to see your mined coin available 
i think so the difficulty is about now i mined when it was it seems that this project is attracting attentions

electra

returns amount of money at the given address

replace address with your own wallet address

follow tutorial still cant mine just connect to but not get share

solo or pool 
gpu or cpu

forgive me i still do not understand what the reward for the block

before to the reward unit will be very small
starting with block the reward will be huge

why such a disproportion 


electra

yubaka
april pm
look at pool reward ammount is pool hashrate less than my own hashrate

farsky
april pm
did i understand correctly that after block will be only pos 


euroline
april pm
very fun its because reward is xxxx pool is showing xxx and its in your dashboard it shows like xxxxxxxxx so everything is okay but my fault i pushed net diff up to the sky then tried to mine


farsky
april pm
everything is stuck or broken
the last block is there is no more


euroline
april pm
need some time


itismoneyme
april pm
difficulty is high and the pool is empty
last block is found more than three hours ago
 
dev i think now we have hashrate problem
 per block is too low to attract and keep hashing power for day i do not hate this project so consider this as a friendly comment 


electra
april pm
the early day will have a hard time with the hash rate but i believe it will slowly progress as there is an expectation at the end of it ill connect a few computers to it on monday to help the chain progress if it continues like this

waiting for a super bonus perhaps the mining cost is too high now 

electra
april am
i am not the pool manager contact euroline for that i agree with you he should at for these day lower the withdrawal fee

electra
april am
diff is very volatile so far miners with both high and low hash rates have come to try out the electra network if i remember this is your first time at mining yes at least you have practiced and know what to do when the big bonuses arrive i suggest you also try and join a pool as practice because when the super rewards bonanza arrives i predict the difficulty will spike and solo miners will have a tougher time

electra
april am
node are in the source code and working perfectly so far when you download the wallet you should be able to connect without adding extras into the conf file

euroline
april pm
thats what im doing right now

hoop
april pm
 is wallet testalso is there exchange your roadmap for this coin is not so clear

electra
april pm
roadmap is in the op

it is not a wallet test wallets have been tested block rewards are low at the moment to allow miners to finetune their equipment setup pools spread the word experiment with transaction and solve issues they come across in preparation for the super rewards bonanza stage i believe the rate of participation and distribution can be relatively better this way

i plan to get listed at least one exchange after block is passed electras code was purposefully written to be compatible with the requirements of all mainstream cryptocurrency exchange

what is the status of the exchange application for this coin



ttntt
april am
block stop ？

electra
april am
hello gradius i have updated the announcement section of the op with the following

there have been issues with electras difficulty retarget and because of this the blocks are getting mined at about half the rate they are supposed to be mined these past few day i have been considering whether to fork electra or leave it be and instead update the op website i have decided to not fork electra but by doing so at the current rate the super blocks are expected to arrive in day rather than day and the super rewards bonanza may take hours rather than when pos begins difficulty retarget be an issue therefore as this issue is temporary it is not worth a fork in my opinion if you agreedisagree let me know in the thread

due contemplating whether i should fork or not i postponed the yobit application until the upcoming weekend note that after i apply it may also take another week for the exchange to add electra the op will also be updated soon to avoid confusion

an upstart exchange has contacted me saying that they voluntarily added electra and even put buy orders in exchange for dogecoin if you need to buysell eca check out this link

no blocks are moving fine sometimes when the difficulty rises too high and hash rate drops blocks progress slower until the difficulty readjusts we are at block currently

windows protector app defender has removed electra qt wallet not appdata files as malware anybody else has same result 




electra
may pm	

i am aware of this issue and it has been stated in the op since launch day bitdefender also has the same issue it is very irregular that virustotal result marks microsoft and bitdefender as safe yet such problems are experienced this is something i am prioritizing to fix in the first update package i suggest you try uploading the electraqt file to virustotal yourself if you want to be assured the wallet is clean for now the only way to prevent the electraqt from being deleted is to add it as an exception in your antivirus program



greendefender

nice to see you again is there a date for release update package means bevor or after staking orgy 



electra
june am	

the update package will be released when the number of active and consistent node increase significantly i also need to observe how electra performs during the pos stage it will not be released within the next months even if the node increase because i will be focusing on some of electras medium term goals stated in the op in other words there is no set date for release yet

also it seems that my network sync is extremely slow im stuck on blocks remaining having connections to the electra network

marimbadude
june am	
found a solution just disabled intel gpu and it seems to work

getting mhs but the wallet is still stuck at blocks remaining

marimbadude
june am
launched ccminer from command line claims that i have mhs

however im not sure how to see if i got something or not and the network is still slow with active connections and blocks remaining the strange thing is when it was stuck before i just reopened the wallet and it downloaded around blocks before freezing again after that ive done the same thing multiple times downloading some blocks and closing the wallet as soon as it froze

however it doesnt seem to work as i have blocks remaining weird

as far as i understand these issues are due to the lack of active connections my conf contains all the node ive found in this thread

i see a problem with this bonanza staking let me explain this some day before i was able with my geforce gtx around mhs 
create blocks per hour to both my wallet or to ecapool nethash rate was around mhs and diff around 

today in pre bonanza phase nethash rate is around mhs with a diff of around ecapool holds hashpower

monday at bonaza phase big chinese miners will point their power to eca blockchain result mininig to your own wallet is useless mining over ecapool can be useless too because or more electra coin will travel to china

marimbadude

i kinda agree with you however i dont see a reason why china should pay attention to electra at this point

lets just wait and see what happens

i dont think this can be correct is it

bonanza has started yeah

stats from now diff nethash rate mhs poolhash rate only that means only every th block goes to our pool hello china 

maybe our dev can support our pool with parts of premine

everybody important announcement

the value for circulating supply on coinmarketcap is not updating even though i gave them electras block explorer url it is stuck on if it updated properly electra with the current price would be in the top right now

i need everyone who can to message gliss or write to coinmarketcap and let this concern be known a top ranking would do a great deal for electra giving it much more recognition more recognition leads to more volume and a sustainable cryptocurrency

itismoneyme

with diff mining with gpu is useless 

dirrvil
june am	

hey guys this is my first time mining ive been getting mhs for about and hour an a half now and have received eca is this normal
if i continue to mine at this rate for hours will i get anything at all or should i just stop now


electra
june am	

those who have communicated with gliss before message him directly about the issue

those who dont know gliss go to coinmarketcapcomrequest formi want to request to modify information on an existing cryptocurrency and there write something like

electras value for circulating and total supply on coinmarketcap is not updating it is stuck on 



the more people write the higher chance he will fix this before the first superblocks mature


greendefender
june am	

not really i have pointed my geforce gtx around mhs to eca pool

you are mining at pool fee and you are not donating

our current realtime circulating supply premine not included



httpscryptobecomchainelectraqcirculatingejxiqybtyjvdnerltfdzmcgzcvz



our current realtime price





 billion


we would currently top coinmarketcap if the circulating supply value updates i have no idea why it is stuck at i promise you a bittrex or poloniex listing will happen if coinmarketcap can fix this in time we have actually become the first cryptocurrency to pass bitcoin market cap but nobody can see it


octavarium
june am	

what mean stuck at that block or what


itismoneyme
june am	
the real price will be definitely lower than this that price is for very low reward state which is finished now




jaerin
june am	

only btc in buy orders on the market those people who left buys in are going to be sad when these coin actually hit exchange wallets and get sold

just because you have a price now doesnt mean it is going to sustain that after you release another billion coin id guess the price will be if the current price stands 

well see though

electra
june am	

 eca is circulating according to coinmarketcap it is the value from day ago

electra
if the circulating supply in coinmarketcap gave realtime value as it is supposed to we would currently be what the price becomes after the superblocks i dont know but a spot on coinmarketcap would help

block time is about min now so super reward stage seems to take hours as said in ann

yeah i feel the same but i was able to hit a block lol i think ill dump asap before someone else will dump wth the current price which is still very high for this coin i think the strategy to ahve a big super block and very small block is bad and will kill the coin

how much time can it take for unconfirmed balance to become confirmed and why is my wallet offline and not syncing

about day to confirm at the moment and please read faq to sync your wallet

oh okay sorry for stupid questions but if i stop mining with unconfirmed balance will i still get those coin

beil
june pm	

how long is the pool going to be down


chs
june pm	


tell us how the coin from bonzana stage should be confirmed when block is the end
a lot of confirmations block needed


jaerin
june pm	

lol yeah right people became richer than bill gates someone has no clue how dilution of coin or stocks work you cant split your stock shares and tell everyone they just doubled their money the price always splits right along with the stock split the same thing happens here

 coin billion means the price splits times right along with it so that price becomes per share

also imagine that someone publishing an article written and paid for by the coin creator and of course it must be true someone will take your money and post something online that is a fact no amount of disclaimers is going to change the fact that it was still written and paid for by a totally biased source this is like a trump style liefest in here its like you drank your own koolaid and now are seeing things that no one else can see

euroline
june pm	

so pow is over you can withdraw your coin then they will be confirmed

chs
june pm	

how they are not confirmed

knathein
june pm	

the pool is down because pow stage is completely over now it is pos stage if i remember correctly someone said it takes like confirmations to get your unconfirmed to confirmed to sent to your wallet i have no idea why it is that high and maybe the op can expand on that but i personally dont mind waiting

electra
june pm	

temporarily made the premine wallet stake to take the chain forward but need to wait for it to mature each time

beil
june pm	

that doesnt make sense the pool network server is down and coin cant confirm confirms reqd until comes back online

knathein
june pm	
is there any way to tune down the needed confirmations confirmations required would at that point take day weeks to get everything from the pool for everyone to get to the wallets then an additional confs required to go unconfirmed in the wallet to confirmed



chs
june pm	

please provide us an better explation would the chain only have one block each day or
so means min year before confirmation is done

electra
june pm	
someone has pm ed me that they have eca in their wallet and will stake it network server is still up


beil
june pm	

i am running a local node and its saying that there is no server to get work from and why would the pool show network hash na



electra
june pm	

pool is no longer used as pow is over all you need to do now is if you have confirmed eca in your wallet keep it open




electra
june pm	

i wrote down a list of usernames of people who mined before the bonanza ill message them as they may have confirmed eca in their wallet



chs
june pm	

and for us there dosent how do we get the unconfirmed eca from the pool
how long time will confirmation take


euroline
june pm	

im trying to stake with some of them but still no success




beil
june pm	

this is bullshit how the hell does anyone get confirmations of coin sitting on a pool if there is nothing running to confirm them majority of miners who used the pool will be unable to retrieve any of the coin they have mined there is something very wrong with this methodology

chs
june pm	

indeeeeed and mr electra do not want to answer the critical questions but instead dealing with bad explanations




beil
june pm	

well ppl looks like we were taken for a ride 

weve just wasted day of energy money and time mining for some morons egoagenda

marimbadude
june pm

i dont think so there is no point taking months just to do that and even if that was the point what will the supposed scammer have bag of coin which are yet not even listed on major exchange

knathein
june pm	

hey its not bad NNOs bear right now maybe there is a way to fix or change it idk

as marimbadude said yes there is a lot of information still to be fully clarified on how we can get this moving along but saying its a scam at the first sight of something wrong is stupid if that was the fact i would call centurylink comcast xfinity verizon cricket att etc etc etc a scammer because people have troubles with them allllllllll the time heck verizon just raised my bill for no reason and after day of blowing up in their faces they finally realized it was their mistake and credited me off my next bill

beil
june pm	

so please explain to me how you are going to get your coin confirmed
since it takes confirmations and the bonanza had a duration of blocks
i have been mining for several years and have never encountered anything this ridiculous


moby
june pm	

im running the wallet from the early day but have only mined before the reward party so i think that will never stake

marimbadude
june pm	

i dont know this is my third mining experience cant say that im a pro
however what i know for sure is that there is a reason for everything done in this particular case i cant find any its just pointless
i agree that its weird but lets just wait and ask the dev so we can understand whats happening


tsik
june pm	
lmao getting popcorn


electra
june pm	

do not worry people i will not abandon electra i will work on a fix but it may take a few day until then i urge you to stay patient

jaerin
june pm	

electra shouldnt you the coin creator have confirmed coin to stake lol this is such a joke dont even know how their own coin is supposed to work


jaerin
june pm	

how about you make more blocks that dont give any rewards that people can mine

knathein
june pm	

that could be a good fix or even a small reward



marimbadude
june pm	

indeed i second that


zeus

june pm	

electra it was premine at billion coin what is problem of running pos with them



tsik
june pm	

no reward is better make dev use his electricity to move the blockchain lol



eur
june pm	

this is our reward 
httpscryptobecomaddressejxiqybtyjvdnerltfdzmcgzcvz

beil
june pm	

you have to be kidding what and waste another week of mining for nothing go right ahead but i am not about to waste any more effort on this crap

it is obvious that this has been set up by a novice and singular at that when most coin are developed by teams of people that know what they are doing

the writing was on the wall when he posted those delusional statements about the value of the coin what a crock of shite this is one ill be writing off as a bad experience good luck ppl


tsik
june pm	

yea making the bonanza stage shorter than blocks needed for coin to mature was a critical error how could you not forsee it dev



epicfailman
june pm	

block income 
what is it dev

knathein
june pm	

it may be an error but ive been chatting with him through pm and he is going to either change the confirmations requirement or create the reward blocks to push through the bonanza stage to get everything confirmed i suggested to him change it to like confirmations for now or the reward blocks


bitcamilo
june pm	

good NNOs i hope dev will do something



electra
june pm	

important
do not worry people i will not abandon electra i will work on a fix but it may take a few day the current problem is that not enough people are able to stake also those who can stake and find a block must wait hours before they can stake again this is a design issue and i will fix it asap until then i urge you to stay patient

epicfailman

knathein
june am	

i am able to log into my account just fine but the coin are still unconfirmed



anthrogic
june am	

all coin mined currently during the bonanza are unconfirmed because they need block confirmations
until they are validreleased the issue the dev is working on now is that nobody has any coin to stake so no blocks are being mined
so nobody is receiving their coin which they need to stake essentially the block chain is stuck while electra works on it
worry not youll receive your coin


jaerin

june am	
its not a bug its obvious manipulation of a system that electra obviously doesnt understand just because a price was one thing today if you add billion coin the price doesnt stay the same the second the coin actually hit a wallet that could sell the price would have been gone you guys act like the daily volume of the coin doesnt matter its not just a simple coin sold for therefore all billion coin are worth each market dilution is a very basic economy idea

httpwwwinvestopediacomtermsddilutednormalizedearningspershareasp

you issue more shares or release more coin and the price per coin goes down unless someone puts more money in to raise the price back up most beginners in trading know more than what has been demonstrated here

hey dev to assist in mining some blocks how about forwarding a bunch of coin to those with electra addresses to assist with mining via wallet staking this will speed up the process and keep the doubters at bay the coin can be returned afterwards

no dev no answer and unsynchronized client congratulations your coin is dead

electra
june pm	
dont worry guys i am working on it the fast solution is going to involve a hard fork i will also be adding NNO seed node while i am at it


if the hard fork does not happen the scenario below will happen

right now there seems to be only about people with confirmed eca in their wallet by block about people will have confirmed eca for staking as there were some people mining blocks before the bonanza i estimate it will take about day to reach block if the people stake daily when the next people assuming they transferred some eca from the pool to their wallets get confirmed the next block where many people will be confirmed is block will take day to reach if everyone who became confirmed on block stake daily after that confirmed eca in wallets will be in the s and things will move much faster everyone remaining can get their eca within day this scenario is based on many assumptions and i believe a fork would be a much better solution


keep in mind that this kind of distribution of coin was never tried before and it was hard to anticipate while NNOly designing some parameters how many people would be using the coin before the bonanza and after it

jaerin
june pm	

no it seemed like you just had no clue how to design a coin and plan for your actual end of your bonanza you didnt seem to think about how the confirmations would work at all and made gross assumptions about how websites like coinmarketcap would just ignore the market dilution and put you at even though it is obvious that would never have happened then you went and paid to write an article trying to claim that electra was market cap coin knowing that it wasnt even possible because all your coin are locked in the blockchain how about a little admission of your clearly lacking any real knowledge of how this was supposed to actually work now youre doing the research that should have been done before the coin was released and someone is telling you how you might fix it dead coin is dead no market worth anything is going to trust this coin for anything but a useless failed gimmick

epicfailman

	
june pm	

dev what about technical airdrop
 eca for all

markus
june pm	

lol we can take this oportunity to swap coin and lunch a NNO blockchain and wallet pos a reduction from to millions coin or we wait for a better solution






minerja
june pm	

im happy to wait day not in any rush and why should we lose millions of coin cos a few people want to try to make a few bucks

besides if you look at nova theres only orders for around k eca so whoever manages to get their coin confirmed on there first will clean house and unless anyone else wants to trade then its game over
so i say let the stakers stake lets see it unfold dev if you can lower pool payout to eca that will help many more peeps get some eca out which in turn will help move things alongorlet us mine another blocks at payout
my best guess is if you hard fork it we all lose


ayers
june pm	

so what happened exactly the sync is still there but it cant sync its stay unsynching forever it was working good before this superblock thing i think it has to do with this this also happened to sweepstakecoin after the super block the coin forked and was barely recuperable

micdvd
june am	

i have coin in my personal wallet i am one of the or that do however they will not stake it says i am staking and showing me a weight but i have yet to create a block or stake anything i saw this coming as any normal person should have everyone and their mom was mining directly to nova and no one had personal wallets open so i made small inputs into my personal wallet as soon as i could knowing that with no one having anything in a person wallet no one could stake and move the chain with those inputs in my wallet i should be able to stake times depending on how long those coin are held up in the stake like i said though my wallet has been open for a long time and it still hasnt created a block



tsik
june pm	

just hard fork it back to block and do no reward pow then u can use a raspberry pi to move the chain or whatever without spending a lot of resources




marimbadude

june pm	

dev i think it would be nice to stay in touch with the community and update more often on the current state of affairs silence is dangerous when it comes to blockchain problems


knathein
june pm	

i have been in contact with electra the dev he said that i have realized at the current state since a hard fork requires the blocks to progress which they cant this approach wont work and as a result of that as of right now it seems like he is going to reenable pow mining for a while with block rewards and encourage people to create multiple staking addresses so when the pos switch does happen again everyone with all the millions of coin will be staking dozens of times per day he states that the eta on that is to weeks no eca will be lost in this process everyone just hops on the network again and mine until the bonanza stage gets through

i will try to keep updated as well and see if we cant get the eta sooner

hope this helps 

edit another thing i forgot to mention is he was also playing with the idea of when it goes to the pos stage again making the stake times between and minutes so that way it will truly be dozens of times per day each address that is staked across the network this is all of the updated information that i have so far for now but i will talk to him and see if he cant give an update from himselfpost something on the op as i can tell though he is trying to work out the kinks as hard as he can

jaerin

june pm	
people lost about day of mining power into this super bonanza and ended up getting nothing at all in return if the dev has a plan to fix it why does it take weeks to implement

its a scam because it was based on a failed premise of being market cap based on the price of coin turning into billion without any kind of dilution of the market it was just a gimmick to try and trick the market cap websites into acting like this coin is some how legit by manipulating a formula that the dev couldnt even understand


joder
june pm	

while a solution is found the pos should be working

well it can not work because there are only two active node and the wallets never sync

the dev says there are not enough wallets with money
well he should create accounts of windows or ubuntu and create each one a wallet deposit eca synchronize return master node and finally put them in pos mode

the dev has eca in his wallet obtained in block of pow
httpscryptobecomchainelectrahicount

joder
june pm	

and if for some reason did not have them and it was a mistake the eca he has also mined blocks so he must have more than eca



marimbadude
june pm	

the market cap thing was not the meta idea of the coin as i understood correct me if im wrong

i agree about the mining day however i dont consider anything a loss yet if dev will abandon electra and the chain will be stuck forever with pool disappearing into the void then yes it was a scam now its just work in progress yes it takes a long time its not pleasant to see the block topping the block explorer day after bonanza but at the same time dev has nowhere to dump coin the chain is still and the only scammy thing dev can possibly do is taking coin that are not worth anything much as well as poorly working blockchain getting backlash from the community so its not worth it in my opinion

knathein
june pm	

man you are so salty that you have to create a brand NNO account and spam this thread

surely if you know how anything works that changing things codingprogramming etc takes time i mean i dont know about you but he isnt someone like microsoft and blizzard entertainment that has employees and can fix something in the blink of an eye surely if you go out of your way to link several things then copy and paste it in a double post you would know that a man team of a crypto coin would take some time and energy out of his day that he may have a full time job to fix something that went bad

right now its still under work i am sure that you would know that if you were to create a cryptocoin all by yourself you would rather be focused on getting a problem fixed and know that it would take a long time to fix if you are by yourself right

micdvd
june am	

as i NNOly said one page back this happened because everyone mined directly from the pool to their novaexchange addresses not one person stopped to think oh hey maybe i should deposit into my own person address so that when it switches to pos only there will be something to stake that is why there is only wallets open one being the exchange and one being mine i was apparently the only one who saw this coming and made sure to make deposits into my own person wallet so that there would be something to stake and hopefully move the chain everyone only cares about their coin being in the exchange so they can sell them and that mindset is why there isnt any stakeable coin to move the chain



minerja
june am	

micdvd would you mind not speaking for me

you know nothing about how i mined this coin
how i had mined it for weeks before the superblocks or how i was mining the superblocks direct to my wallet

the simple fact is the dev didnt think this through probably from lack of experience
i have left my wallet open many hours but since it wont sync not really a lot i can do to help

i dont know if its a scam coin but its definitely broken and your not helping
anyway lets see hope he can fix it i doubt it makes much difference anymore to be honesteven if he gets it working i think we simply ended up with full wallets that noone wants to tradelets wait and see

micdvd

obviously you didnt read my post a page ago where i said people have mined to their personal wallet so you would be in that people

i do have a very small amount of coin in wallet like eca but i dont think that these coin matter much in terms of pushing the network

knathein

so lets just sit tight and wait i have high hopes for this coin and hope that it will grow after all the clunkiness gets solved 

greendefender
june pm	
have also a very small amount in wallet with two connects but staking does not work because blue syncing arrows will not stop every day after th june it will be harder for blockchain

how the hell some ppl sold eca yesterday at coinexchange 



wklalen
june am	

fuck u dev
u off block

markus
june pm	

lets just wait and maybe things will get better with time and you guys should diversify ur portfolio of coin to prevent this problems




jaerin
june am	

diversification has nothing to do with this no one is saying that this cost anyone other than a couple day of mining power the point is the dev didnt think through how their coin was going to actually have to work before asking people to trust him

now they are silent on the issue which is never a good sign if the coin come through great just means that theyll get dumped on the market and the rest will sit around until someone decided to try and use this as an investment vehicle which i doubt anyone will

then again maxcoin was listed on yobit and that is a known scam coin

june am	

coin has surpassed block 
supply is 
moving to pos

fulcrum
june am	

so my wallet downloading blocks when someone mines a block to go yay

octavarium
june am	
wrong chain good luck


jaerin
june am	

looks legit to me

httpswwwvirustotalcomenfileafddcfbeebeecabbacdcadaddeanalysis

wallet is syncing put stuff that euroline posted in an electraconf in your wallet directory

fulcrum
june am	

so my electraconf is

the wallet is the NNO one

i launch it and it says blocks remaining im doing something wrong here

	



jaerin
june am	
all i did was copy and pasted what euroline posted into a electraconf and nothing else and it is syncing with the NNO blocks

jaerin
june am	

so i guess at this point is there a reason to put more hashing power onto the pool i dont think the blocks get found faster if the difficulty is going to be variable is it it seems to me like it is more of a countdown timer to give people time to update their wallets before the coin start flooding out



knathein
june am	

how is it the wrong chain we have a NNO wallet download

fulcrum
june am	

im finding blocks for the first time in my life with my r 

but my wallet is not syncing still says downloaded of and too sleepy to go for it maybe tomorrow

marimbadude
june am	

is it safe at this point to try withdrawing a micro amount of coin from pool



knathein
june am	

i dont think you can even withdraw from pool yet lol all of mine are still unconfirmed



marimbadude
june am	

dunno somehow i have and yeah i cant minimum cashout exceeds the amount i have confirmed



knathein
june am	

yeah i would wait everything seems to be getting situated and fixed slowly but surely

octavarium
june am	
many people only wait conf
too much coin


marimbadude
june am	

just wanted to test if its working but yeah the fact that the problem is solving out is great



jaerin
june am	

it may be working but youd still have to wait for the blocks to confirm to see the transfer anyways so it will be at least a few day if not more




vak
june am	
i think that dev must update the wallet on the pool httpspoolcoinminersinfo



jaerin
june am	

everyone will have to update their wallets to get the coin that were mined



electra
june am	

a NNO wallet was released via the pool mailing list developed by a dev experienced in forks from multiple coin download it here
httpsgithubcombumbacoinelectrareleases
if youre using windows download electraqtwinvzip
if youre using linux wallet is in file titled source code


there seems to be a sync error that i am looking into but blocks are moving

electra
june am	

i was not aware this pool existed if someone knows the manager please message him about the NNO wallet otherwise hope he reads the thread



itismoneyme
june am	

good work thank you dev please update ann with NNO links

jaerin
june am	

if you setup the electraconf that euro posted on the previous page it will sync okay



gohryangoh
june am	

i tried that but it didnt work maybe i did it wrongly any advice


anthrogic
june am	

same boat here s

guess ill put my rig on the pool so we can crank out these pow blocks and get our coin

marcboy
june am	
wallet is not syncing how can i fix the syncing problem do you guys have a slack channel

bumbacoin
june am	
if your wallet is saying it has over blocks remaining

httpsgithubcombumbacoinelectrareleases



edit
update yr wallet for fix



anthrogic
june am	

interesting so were out of sync but actually in sync the wallet just thinks were out of sync because we forked



marcboy
june am	

how much electra will i need in my account to stake and how can i be a peer node for the network does peer node get rewarded

minerja
june am	

hi

can we solo mine it says downloading blocksget work failed
just thinking if we can solo with reward being coin then wallet can be staking earlier instead of waiting for threshold on pool

marcboy
june am	

can someone done coin to my wallet please

 etrimynndlptkhcaqyhaeywslzf

that would be great if you guys have a faucet

marcboy
june am	

how can i mine with a mac computer



octavarium
june am	

how about nova need update wallet or not 

electra
june am	

i advise to halt trading there till i confirm they updated



octavarium
june am	
seems good

yubaka
june am	
any NNOs about excange wallet syn
 
my mining hashrate is bigger than it be before mhmh what is that


bumbacoin
june am

okay discovered source of sync problems
it was my typo p

i had checkpoint instead of 

everyone needs to update to v
httpsgithubcombumbacoinelectrareleasestagv





the previous versions v and v will become an issue when the chain actually hits block 
which will be in approx weeks
they will reject the real chain

	


fulcrum
june am	

probably not but can we do something about confirmation thing it is way too much

yubaka
june am	
blockexplorer is dead


bumbacoin
june am	

there is no confirmations in the src no idea where that came from







zeus
june am	

coin is dead unfortunately 
my million coin have not been confirmed on the pool and now they simply do not exist
blockexplorer froze on block

marimbadude
june am	

it probably operates using old data


marimbadude
june am	

download the NNO wallet we are currently at block dont use the cryptobe at this moment use this insteadhttpsecaaccpoolpwindexphppagestatisticsactionblocks
coin still need confirmation

octavarium
june pm	

so if we update and coin received from pool
we wait nova update wallet right 
reality drama

fulcrum
on line of the maincpp
ode
int cmerkletxgetblockstomaturity const

 if iscoinbase iscointake
 return 
 return max ncoinbasematurity getdepthinmainchain


so at the beginning of maincpp ncoinbasematurity defined as but then there is this 

check httpsecaaccpoolpwindexphppagestatisticsactionblocks

it says confirmations needed this was the whole problem why the coin got stuck in the first place imo i might be wrong tho

zeus
june pm	
its joke
how i can update walet in pool
i used poolcoinminersinfo when i mined bonanza blocks

marimbadude
june pm	

oh my bad i didnt read the message in a right waybut well download the NNO wallet anyways chain is moving steadily

bumbacoin
june pm	
well there you go confirmations indeed very strange
it certainly doesnt help with moving coin

when i advised extending pow i was not aware of it
i mean i saw in thread the mention but could find no obvious trace of it that adds nearly two day oo

i will have to give that further consideration and liaise with dev

tsik
june pm	
have the first bonanza blocks been confirmed yet


electra
june pm	
latest wallet version

httpsgithubcombumbacoinelectrareleases

if youre using windows download electraqtwinvzip
if youre using linux wallet is in file titled source code

minerja
june pm	
okay

my first bonanza block has been confirmed but cannot withdraw
error you have exceeded the pools configured eca warning threshold please initiate a transfer pool httpsecaaccpoolpw

any ideas

octavarium
june pm	
maybe stake 

minerja
june pm	

unfortunately although confirmed in pool cannot withdraw to wallethope some one can fix this quick cos the blocks are going to be coming fast nowneed away to get them to wallet for stakingand someone needs to give nova a wake up call their wallet it still not in use



octavarium
june pm	
hahaa
lol
long story
confirme but cant withdrawl
what next 
withdrawl from pool but cant trade to nova cause update wallet

zeus
june pm	

super but who will return to me bitcoin which i spent on renting a hash for finding a bonabza block that is now gone

bumbacoin
june pm	
both
electraqtwinv and
electraqtosxv are now available

markus
june pm	
looks like novaexchange is in the old chain the pool probably is blocking the withdraw request to prevent people lost coin if u had an old address update your exchange and wallet address at the pool


marimbadude
june pm	

hey if i had a small amount of coin in my wallet before downloading the NNO wallet and i update the pool withdrawal address to the same that i had before will i get my coin i know that the question is weird but i have such situation for the first time so im making sure that its gonna be alright

euroline
june pm	

probably yeah

jaerin
june pm	

super bonanza blocks have started to become fully confirmed and crediting the pool accounts with the coin

i would make sure your payout wallet address is correct because it looks like it is doing autopayouts and there isnt an option on the pool to disable them entirely even the high amount is only so it will likely trigger

euroline
june pm	

pool withdrawals are enabled



valkad
june pm	
i received coin on my wallet



thorthchariot
june pm	
hey there is a miner available for cpu miner with algorithm nist i have cpumineroptwindows who has nist algorithm but he crash on this algorithm all others is working


minerja
june pm	
hey guys dont all rush to nova the swedes are on holiday until monday so virtually no updatessee httpsnovaexchangecomNNOs
seems like they are having a party

minerja
june pm	
what gpu do u have cos i have a cheap ti and it mines eca well

marimbadude
june pm	

got a message on a dashboard

we are investigating issues in the backend your shares and hashrate are safe and we will fix things asap

payouts disabled you will not receive any coin to your offline wallet for the time being



markus
june pm	
nova still in the old chain better to change ur address or maybe the coin will be lost


anthrogic
june pm	
fixed thanks i advise everyone solomine so they can get the block reward in their wallet if they solve and stake





zeus
june pm	

how many confirmations need in NNO wallet



anthrogic
june pm	

now we wait even longer for our electra


marimbadude
june pm	
the message is gone tho seems that everything is fine

minerja
june pm	
just confirms needed for wallet


leosfidare
june pm	

hey guys im NNO at mining and i have a little bit of questions after a while of research my doubts are primarly what are the node for and how do we use them

and according to the pool i have like coin paidout this means i made like k usd at usd each out of almost nowhere or im missing something

thank you guys

markus
june pm	

yes they change the number of confirmations only and you can get ur coin available to spend


markus
june pm	
sometime ur wallet doesnt sync and you need to create a list of node to connect it you go to the appdata file and create a file with the list of node so you can sync the wallet looks like this
 you will only get that money if theres enough liquidity in the market when people moves electra coin to the exchange the value will drop


marimbadude
june pm	

got some coin confirmed in the wallet spendable



mrmdz
june pm	
mine says 


zeus
june pm	
dev when do you list eca to another exchandes
and how do you solve the problem with novaexchange there is not updated wallet

fulcrum
june pm	

when you get or send coin to someone it needs only confirmations to be usable however mined blocks needs to be confirmed times still



jaerin
june pm	
novaexchange has a note about limited support due to swedish holiday it will likely have to wait for them to come back

 limited support until monday

all swedes are celebrating swedish midsummer httpsyoutubeuzlpgooaq so the support will be limited until monday june 


marimbadude
june pm	

agree i think bittrex would be very interested in electra especially pos however i do beilieve that after the next completed roadmap stage electra will have to extend the roadmap further and at the moment we cant do anything about nova holiday



zanead
june pm	
hello i have a question what better idea for saving coin on the wallet or pool 



tsik
june pm	

encrypted wallet



jaerin
june pm	

always encrypted wallet preferably cold storage but that likely isnt possible right now best to have multiple backups of your encrypted wallets



robo
june pm	

hi what is electra min stacking age
i cant find this info


vingaard
june pm	
one question what is happening with novaexchange wallet they say that the last block received was on 

jaerin
june pm
looks like minstakeage is hours on the main net

srcmaincpp unsigned int nstakeminage hours

jaerin
june pm	

the wallet hasnt been updated to the NNO version yet novaexchange admins are on vacation until next week and so it likely wont be updated until then

vingaard
june pm	

ok thanks for the answer so i figure ill have to wait until nova updates its wallet thanks again 

bitcamilo
june pm	
thankyou admin now my wallet is syncronised and some coin transfered to my wallet




fulcrum
june pm	
it seems like people gonna dump whatever they can when nova updates their wallet sad 
marimbadude
june pm	
not really faster the dump wave clearer the path for the growth

brinneminer
june pm	

when does our coin will be confirmed on the pool i still dont even have coin confirmed does it will be confirmed one day coin from the super bonanza h mining

epicfailman
june pm	
dev what about bittrex
when pow blocks left eca will be good coin for bittre

fulcrum
calculate friend

if you mined at that means your coin will start confirming at which is 
and last of them will be confirmed at which is 

marimbadude
june pm	
yes yes yes bittrex loves pos we should make it a priority exchange

mrmdz
june pm	
is there a way to see which blocks we mined

hi whats with the coin that were on the zpool

bumbacoin
june am	

nova exchange devs are busy having fun

devrobot
june am	
is it too late to mine this coin
apparently during the first hours people got a ton of coin already

markus
june am	
yup is to late there was a time when we mined alot of coin cuz the block reward was huge but its over now


bitcamilo
june am	
too bad NNOs so i hope nova will update wallet soon


electra
june pm	

coinmarket has informed me they are using the latest version of the wallet you can safely trade there novaexchange will probably take a few more day due to a holiday in their country

fulcrum
june pm	
tested sent eca wallet updated succesfully testing withdraw still waiting for hours



darksoc
why people is selling it for doge
even if it will be worth just satoshilike mooncoin or similiarthey could get easily a lot more

yubaka
june pm	
electra will be with good price after year im hold this coin


jaerin
june pm	
because the price with coin total was like per coin there are now billion coin you do the math



fulcrum
june pm	
we gotta go on yobit or bittrex asap


electra
june pm	

everyone

due to the help provided by the bumbacoin dev in creating the NNO wallets he has been sent eca from the premine account i mentioned this would happen previously in the email sent to you all by the pool manager the bumbacoin developers help was highly significant as his contribution saved electra from a very difficult situation this payment also means that a very talented developer has become a stakeholder in electra who has an interest in making this cryptocurrency better for all

jaerin
june pm	

woot im seeing mined blocks from staking 


fulcrum
june pm	

he deserved that imo now its your turn mate we need exchange and some roadplan to get more serious


euroline
june pm	

all coin from bonzana phase are confirmed about billion still waiting to be withdrawed


bitcamilo
june pm	

dear dev now we are waiting for NNOs for coin


brinneminer
june pm	

will the coin we transfer to novaexchange that is stuck in this will be reach or we will loose them someone can confirm


fulcrum
june pm	

novaexchange guys are on national holiday till they get back and switch to NNO wallet nothing is clear


brinneminer
june pm	

is there a chance we lost the coin if we did transfer before the wallet update


fulcrum
june pm	

if they somehow backup walletdat for every user youll get your coin and it is a reliable site this should be the way


bumbacoin
june am	

great
i am splitting it up into bite size chunks for staking

were still a few day away from the end of pow
and with the distribution of funds it looks like the transition to pos should be much smoother this time

block times will probably be a bit jerky for a while until all the staking wallets split a dozen times or so

knathein
june am	

this may be a silly idea but is anyone good enough to make a dice site with possible investing just a suggestion i am not a good enough coderprogrammer to do that but something simple could be kinda fun to get a few people into it while we wait for nova to get the ball rolling and get a roadmap underway 



jaerin
june am	
so thats means we should split the wallet multiple times if we have a significant amount of coin if so any recommendation of maximum staking size


denking
june pm	

where is my coin

nit anymore unconfirmed abd nothing at novaexchange so i lost it


fulcrum
june pm	

nova wallet still not updated you have to wait for update


zeus
june pm	

i dont understand why my wallet write not staking because yor dont have mature coin there are mil coin with confirmations in my wallet whenll staking work


marimbadude
june pm	

when the extended pow stage ends


epicfailman
june pm	

dev what about next steps
i think we need to repair block explorer first
if we want normal price for eca bittrex we be good choice if you need enchanced account for addding NNO coin i have it coinexchange will be good too
we need macos wallet what about bounty for developing
after end of last pow blocks there is good time for signaturetwitterfacebook bounties
will be good idea to create starting video and host it on youtube making wallet making exchange account trading withdraw etc

bumbacoin
june am	
if you split large inputs into multiple chunks that will help the transition to pos

staking is currently working make sure youve updated to latest wallet v

mac wallet is available

anthrogic
june am	
im only staking of my current electra will that value go up over time how do we actually stake is it automatic


logk
june am	
block already
damn i just blinked my eyes

balance not available after successful stake for how many blocks wow

vak
june am	
any NNOs from nova old wallets



bumbacoin
june am	
this to me looks like it only applies for mined coin
has anyone found their staked coin actually take blocks to become available 

otherwise it should be only 


edit
hmmz theres another pair of brackets hiding in there
my first impression seems incorrect

logk
june am	
 blocks until funds can be spend mined or pos
thats more than likely the reason behind the chain seizing up initially as there were littleno mature funds to stake with

strannik
june am	
hi
there seem to have been a hard fork for electra so there is now two wallets on different height
old source httpsgithubcomelectraelectra
NNO source httpsgithubcombumbacoinelectra

we will update the wallets as soon as possible but at the latest on tuesday june th


regards
novaexchange support team


knathein
june am	
hopefully they can get it to us sooner thatd be cool 

bitcamilo
june am	
ok good NNOs we are waiting for update



logk
june am	
nova updated someone completely dumped on the buy orders

fulcrum
june am	

that was expected

darksoc
june am	
well a good opportunity to get some coin for satoshiand resell it at in weeks


logk
june am	
not really
given the volume it could only have been either dev or bumbacoin because theyd been running the chain privately for some time

any coin which gets destroyed at first opportunity and this transparently should be ashamed of itself

bumbacoin
june am	

lol
the chain has been public since before anyone could move coin no opportunity for private chain shenanigans

not to suggest zeus had anything to do with anything but it seems theyve had access to their super rewards bonanza so it could be anyone 
and looking at the btceca page on nova it seems like only a few million coin were needed to have done the carnage evident

please dont accuse anyone without proper thought thank you


perhaps when cryptobe get around to updating the explorer you can do some digging



darksoc
june am	
it could have been anyoNNOith a r and only maybe hours of mining i got more than kk coinimagine someone that used a cloud mineror gpu for dayalso i believe that both dev and bumbacoin are interested to gain much more than btctoday any coin can reach million market capif it is supported a bitand this mean a value times higherlets be seriousa marketcap of btcat satoshiits too low for a NNO coin that is still alive



strannik

but i managed to sell electr and earn btc

stop fudding and trolling the thread

edit benjy i would expect more from you being a hero member and you are trolling

tsik
so youre trying to say that only people in the western hemisphere are the ones actively trading lmao



knathein
june pm	
the majority of the user on nova are from usa so with that yeah i would say most people arent trading atm 

either way its not very cool to troll the thread the dumpers will dump to get their quick money while the people holding for a better opportunity


marimbadude

cannot consider any traditional cryptocurrency a shitcoin unless the dev can delete the attackers deposits and holds a key to the network its decent

i can not find it with that name at least

june pm	
hi any particular reason u need that miner are you trying to mine eca if so what hardware ill help if i can


bumbacoin
june pm	
there is honestly no point in trying to mine eca now
by the time pow finishes there is the possibility of mining coin if you got all the blocks left 

at the current value they are worth less than satoshi







minerja

also seems like no one is interested in buying at the moeven at satshame

hi guys and dev by the way lets make a slack and telegram group everything will be good

for some reason it seems like my coin stopped staking in my wallet

also is it recommended to split our coin into multiple wallets to allow for better staking at this point

people dumping at sat are miners who want the quick return can you blame them though day pow wasted little to no electricity traders can pick this up at sat and if theyre willing to wait weeksmonths it is easy to make a tonne of profit it all depends on regular updates and development without it there would be no incentive for anyone to risk their money to move the market

any NNO exchange cryptopia coinexchange bittrex and eca will rise now on nova we have more than of total amount it is too much for one exchange and so much coin with low price result of cloud miners work they want to return their money spent on renting

animalroam

hi bumbacoin

im a mac user but if im the only one its fine one of my friend is keeping my coin 

tsik
june pm	
shame there is such a low interest on nova not even btc volume today

marimbadude
june pm	
thats why we need bittrex


bitcamilo
june pm	

i agree with you on this subject i can sell my coin for btc but i am waiting i hope it will be valuable soon


tsik
june pm	

or promote it on nova like those coin up top over there not sure how that works but it would at least expose it to NNO people

edit also looked at the richlist on cryptobe and distribution is surprisingly good i thought top wallet would have much much more coin

marimbadude
june pm	
no offense to nova they are doing a great job but they are much smaller than bittrex and the exposure wouldnt be significant compared to bittrex listing



epicfailman
june am	
steps for bittrex
just interest i can help almost with donate on bittrex wallet but there is no info about NNO exchange




electra
june am	

i want to be sure the pos transition goes smoothly this time before applying to NNO exchange

the bittrex application will happen however there is a lot of application work involved compared to other exchange and it may take months before we get a clear answer

bumbacoin
june am	

were blocks from the end of this pow phase and will then run on pos only

to help with network security please ensure youre running latest version v

httpsgithubcombumbacoinelectrareleases


bitcamilo
june am	

finally electra nice to write something occasionally


ilitirit
june am	

is it normal for the wallet to use cpu when idle


bumbacoin
june am
if you have coin your wallet might be trying to stake

pos does actually use computing power it is similar to pow but far less intensive



	


tsik
june am	
youre right h volume btc



icefrag
june am	

currently the total market cap is only btc at satoshi if the dev develops the project there is a chance of satoshi 

ps
how many confirmations are needed to maturity and staking


marimbadude
june am	
got it good to hear


zeus
june pm	

 confirmations



strannik
june pm	

what do i need for the pic coin for the local wallet


icefrag
june pm
i think about conf
i started my wallet now and staking with confirmation

	

electra
the following exchange links have been added to the op
httpsnovaexchangecommarketdogeeca

httpsnovaexchangecommarketespeca

httpsnovaexchangecommarketkiceca

jaerin
i think my computer ended up bluescreening for some reason and when i try to start electra it pops the following
it then crashes and closes out actually if i ignore then it did go on to open looks like it wont sync the last blocks though

bumbacoin
june am	

crashes can often corrupt database

if it keeps doing that
youll need to delete your copy of the chain and restart

make sure you keep your wallet safe


jaerin
june am	

how do i reset the database without risking my wallet

nevermind it was something int he txleveldb causing issue all synced back up now


moprogress
june am	
eca will rise more than doge soon

if dev can add this coin to coinexchange bittrex poloniex it will even rise up to asafe in no distant time

vak
june am	
stupid guys sell electra for doge e− btc crazy
i think all of us must cancel sat sell orders and just wait
potential buyers are afraid of the number of coin for sale

yubaka
june am	

im bought on low price 

moprogress
june am	
this coin sold at btc in nova all of a sudden in fall to even sat i will advice people to get this coin now as it will rise soon over doge


zeus
june pm	
when full pos will started and what kind of reward will be fo pos


bumbacoin
june pm	
were in full pos now

from the op rewards


anthrogic
june pm	
actually much lower price than satoshi the price is about doge asking price bids are much lower which is around a satoshi
nobody is buying with btc because doge price is the btc price because its lower than a satoshi so dont be expecting satoshi anytime soon

if you want to buy electra buy using doge youll get x more electra than if you bid satoshi with btc

wklalen
june pm	
lol btc httpsnovaexchangecommarketbtceca
this coin dead
dev is cannot removed it

jaerin
june pm	
youd likely need to check with novaexchange if they pay out for staking while in their wallet i would guess not


bumbacoin
july am	
ive sent the dev a pm regarding strange pos payouts

it seems a strange issue of code ordering it looks fine but behaves as we see
basically atm the expected reward is divided by 

fixing it will require adjusting how the code works out stake rewards so it will need another fork


a slight note in regard to how reward is calculated
the min stake age is deducted from reward calculations
so a payout after two day would be worked out minus hours min stake age payout would then be based on day



electra
july pm	
no slack or telegram group at the moment if anybody creates one ill add it to the op


there is a relatively NNO reddit page managed by community members

httpswwwredditcomrelectra

to my knowledge novaexchange does not payout for staking while in their wallet

however you do get the reward for staking if you hold eca in the coinmarket wallet

choobymaverick
july am	
shitty website despite the wonders why it is a weebly site questionable beginnings and roadmap this entire electra eca stuff is obviously an entire scam the developer made a huge premine and dumped the whole bunch on exchange and sold at exorbitant rates i only wonder where the conscience is so many people lost so much to this scam and idiots who still choose to mine really do not see that they are still being scammed by these ruthless criminals if you have the slightest bit of humanity in you i think you would strive to do right by all those people who once believed in this enough to put some money into it create a proper website and get some meaning and life to this through active and dedicated developers for a meaningful cause and who knows what great things will come to you


electra
july am	

electra is in pos now that is why that link looks like that

electra

i want to assure everyone the premine is still in place and can be viewed live anytime via the following link

choobymaverick
july pm	

if your intentions are good and your project real we should be able to feel that engagement by mere visiting the site all i can deduce from thus is a zerovision project with zero build intent and scammy bunch of individuals with the sole intent of ripping good willed individuals of their hard earned cash electra has a big question mark on it and until the developers prove themselves through value delivery and visible progressive works it will remain tagged a scam work well orchestrated by a group of thoughtless careless and ruthless individuals i hope you find the selflove to do whats right in the face of humanity


zeus
july pm	

dev i need ask

wackjelch
july pm	

hey dev when is the pos going to be repaired to give the 
i like this coin but only staking a few coin per day is not good
people will have more interest in this coin once it starts staking correctly

natysoz

i start mining but the wallet is offline and not connecting almost day already

i mine at mhs per second but im the only minning whats going on

jaerin

electra is pos now no more work to mining other than staking coin you can buy some for staking on novaexchange

i run the subreddit which logo are you referring to


bitcamilo
july pm	

price is doge and rising 

bumbacoin
july am	
were working on that now
the issue has been identified but it will require another fork

and because of the necessity of a fork were just making sure this one will be the last one

	


thepowerofd
july am	

yeah this coin has great potential as soon as i heard of it i did the right thing 


moprogress
july am	
price now doge and still rising


damiansee
july am	
electra coin price so pathetic even doge is higher than electra

what do you think about eclectra coin in the future i think it could be scam coin


wackjelch
july pm	
so go buy some doge this coin is clearly not for you


jaerin
july pm	

how is it a scamcoin the market controls the price so if you dont buy any then you cant get scammed you either are an investor in it or not just like dogecoin

what is the future of dogecoin or any of the other hundreds of coin that seem to have no real purpose other than as an investment vehicle

the NNO purpose of dogecoin doesnt even exist anymore and yet it still continues to fluctuate in support and price

	

jrolim
july pm	

up 

kuky
july pm	

i put the coin a year later to see i think the price will certainly be higher than the doge

this version included a trojan 

i am using electraqt from the begining this is first warning message from kaspersky


zhty
july am	

would like to see a reply to this


icefrag
maybe it was planned from the beginning 

kkjack
july am	

whats the total amount of the coin issued can i buy it now i only get through mining this year the seller sold in mine always hear


electra
july am	

important

this wallet was directly released to the thread by bumbacoin without me checkingtesting it i suggest that no one downloads the NNO wallet until bumbacoin explains why viruses were detected and sheds light on the issue he has been a great contributor and i do trust him so it may be an honest mistake but for the time being do not download thanks for being sharp a community everyone

valkad
july am	

im using nod and everything is clean i trust bumbakoin more than kaspersky


electra
july am	

i think he will like this compliment out of antivirus programs a virus only seems to be detected by kaspersky so far i have done a bitdefender scan and the wallet came clean however from the perspective of an outside investor it does not look good even if one antivirus in virustotal detects an infection so ideally it would be better if we get this fixed


bitcamilo
july pm	
i have been supporting electra since the beginning but we must be skeptical for crypto world there was no this situation in any version and this is a very suspicious situation i am sure bumbakoin will make a statement about this situation




denking
july pm	
so can we download it or not lol


thepowerofd
july pm	

thanks for the answer dev and keep it going 



bumbacoin
july pm	

there should not be a trojan
none were included 

no idea why its showing except for the generic long time issue of crypto coin wallets showing alerts due to the inbuilt miner


heres the virustotal for previous wallet
httpswwwvirustotalcomenfileedefecacfadacabacbeanalysis

it shows the same result


anthrogic
july pm	

so based off this block pos rewards will be fixed on the NNO fork




udwchyo
july pm	
this is not the previous one this is the current 
previous kaspersky clear



bumbacoin
july pm	

sorry my mistake
this is the previous virustotal report on previous wallet v
httpswwwvirustotalcomenfilefecabdeaedefebdcfcdffefefdanalysis

it lists issue as well

im tired 

edit
ffs now its issues i really am tired p my mistake



tarz
july pm	
why not upload it to virustotal and see what online malware checker says boombacoin the guy has a record of posting nonstuff drinking substances that are waste matter of a human body and other not so appropriate things that most of you would rather avoid if he uploaded the malware it is the first sign of his soul ailment



bumbacoin
july pm	
lol
i think we all enjoy a good dose of idiocy from time to time thanks for today clown action


but apart from your amusing outlook
youll see above there are links to virustotal
it lists kapersky as finding an issue

crypto wallets have a long and glorious history of triggering virus scans

there are no virus or otherwise nefarious inclusions in the wallet releases by me

please feel free to behave in a manner which makes you feel safe



edit
earlier i checked virustotal report for prior release v and thought i found similar virus report
however now its clear with v showing no issues
im tired and no idea what i was looking at p

there is very little difference between code bases so i have no idea why kapersky decided to flag this version and not the other

i can try to recompile it tomorrow to see if it comes up different i dont see why but given the minor differences in code that trigger this report
perhaps recompiling it will actually change the outcome


jaerin
july pm	
did you increase the compression settings of the executable usually any kind of compression or obfuscation will trigger these generic alerts

as i recalled when i first scanned the NNO release when i downloaded it it came up clean

now it is detected for ircbot

httpswwwvirustotalcomenfileedefecacfadacabacbeanalysis


electra
july am	

ill wait for a few hours and see if the recompile works be nice to bumbacoin people if not for his effective fork electra may have still been in limbo


electra
july am	
yes


bumbacoin
july am	

i have recompiled it and uploaded to releases

httpsgithubcombumbacoinelectrareleasestagv



for whatever magical reason
virustotal is currently giving this one issues
httpswwwvirustotalcomenfiledcfefdcfaccacfedfeceadfbdfdbanalysis

to compare current uploaded file notice
sha dcfefdcfaccacfedfeceadfbdfdb

this checksum is unique to the file should the file be changed in any way the checksum will change
the recompile has changed it to create a NNO fingerprint

electra
july am	
i can confirm that the latest wallet v now has detections in virustotal after block the NNO wallet intends to

 reduce the block maturity to a lower value the current value is causing the minimum stake age to be higher than hours the minimum stake age will now be hours as NNOly designed

 increase reward yields from staking to for about a year initially promised in the op



download the latest wallet v from here

httpsgithubcombumbacoinelectrareleases

bitcamilo
july am	
thankyou for fast fix update now everything is alright


udwchyo
july am	
virustotal analyzes strange if you reanalyze now it will be again with the NNO version
may be change something in compression

zanead
july am	

hello electra i did try to check it in virustotal but the same thing like before recompiled
httpswwwvirustotalcomenfiledcfefdcfaccacfedfeceadfbdfdbanalysis
i did install it but strange is see this generic on it


electra
july pm	

i also now see a problem with kaspersky if reanalysed such an inconsistency existed in the first electra wallet also virustotal detected nothing yet my paid bitdefender antivirus saw it as a dangerous file and kept removing it i have sent a message to virustotal about these inconsistencies if they reply i will share their answer in this thread

we need to move forward everyone has access to the source code and maybe somebody can one day solve this issue coinmarket and novaexchange have already adopted the NNO wallet novaechange have also reopened the litecoinelectra exchange to enable arbitrage trading for electra holders

no volume eca btc
any idea add other exchange





jaerin
july pm	

thats because it is listed on the doge esp and kip exchange which allowed the price to drop below sat not reason to buy for sat when you can get them for for doge the price is fluctuating so there is a little trading activity

market cap did get up to about k usd but has since fallen back down to k well see if we can get some traction on it it doesnt really offer a lot of features so not sure what is going to happen to make it compete against all the other coin out there

fenn
july pm	

yes i am unsure what the future path teh dev is choosing for this coin at the moment

good work of fixing the problems and getting back on track but whats next

what happend on july with the value of eca
i cant find any posts around july



fenn
july pm	

its where the real value of electra was updated on coinmarket

its wasnt updating ages ago and said there was coin in circulation pushing the cap way up then coin got stuck in the pools after the super bonaza rewards stage that got fixed and trading of millions of coin started

soon after the price dropped to sat on novaexchange but coinmarket went blank showing only s for circulation eventually it updated to the true value on the nd of july

thats the drop you can see

animalroam
july pm	

the cryptobe wallet has been updated to the latest version so it will be reliable during the hardfork


yubaka

electra please add eca for voting on livecoinnet and read rules for add coin thanks


electra
july am	

notification

the premine is has been split between multiple addresses for the purpose of testing


it is not being moved with the intention of selling the full amount will be returned to a single address about a week after the hard fork occurs

electra
july am	

livecoin voting is difficult each user gets vote every day the top currently each have votes if we had active user in eca it would still take us months to reach the top entry by direct payment is easier for livecoin voting is simply not worth pursuing


jaerin

why not just buy some off market and use those or use bumbas coin not sure why you have to move the premine at all


skdsw

it stopped rising

thats a big dream i guess but lets not limit this project but i would not expect it if i were you unless polo had
invested in this project seeing this in bittrex is already a great progress they have their own exchange by the way

nothing exciting to do just run the NNO wallet instead of the old one

but remember kids
always make a back up if you want to keep your coin safe 





sunny

could anybody tell me how to make pos miningi installed wallet and deposit coin there
is it enough to mine


wklalen
july am	
no need mine
coin dead and no project


bumbacoin
july pm	

once youve deposited coin into your wallet
they will take around day to become eligible for staking

when they are eligible when you leave your wallet open they will have a chance to generate a pos block

the chance is based on the size or your input coin deposit and its age
the bigger the older the more chance you have

	


skdsw

wallet open means that wallet is online or something else


sunny

bumbacoin latest wallet is not synchronizingwhat should i do

sir its stuck at blocks only not going up


electra

wallet open means keep it running and yes you must be online


electra
july pm	

do you have any active connections if not add node into the conf file

if you have connections try restarting the wallet if that does not work you need to go to appdataroamingelectra and delete everything except walletdat and then reopen the wallet


electra
july pm	

can you send examples of websites you have made

ideal domain names would be

electrainfo
electranet
electraprojectnet
electraprojectinfo


or since it is a website created by a community member

electracommunitycom org net info

i should also mention that i will update my own website after the hard fork is successful but will still keep the weebly domain

i dont see on the website where we can go to put our electra coin and get the pos reward can someone explain me where to start this i know it is starting soon in a couple block i think

thank you 

	




jaerin
july pm	

you just need to open the electra wallet application with coin in it and let it run if you have encrypted your wallet you will need to unlock the wallet there is a checkbox to only unlock it for staking purposes


brinneminer
july pm	

how can you secure your coin if the wallet is not crypted and unlocked in what way you make them safe


bumbacoin
july am	
please consider how much you value your crypto if its very very very important to you then you should take extreme measures which includes having a seperate system for your wallets

the greatest sense of security is only running it on a safe system

irustotal has sent a reply regarding the inconsistency of their scans for the lastest electra wallet the email correspondence has been shared below


me

i shared a file with virustotal and in the initial scan it had a 
detection ratio

after the file was rescanned it became flagged by kaspersky only

after a few more recans the detection ration is at kaspersky no
longer detected it

why does the result change with each reanalysis the file is the same

httpsvirustotalcomenfiledcfefdcfaccacfedfeceadfbdfdbanalysis

best regards



them

hello

virustotal is not a substitute for any antivirussecurity software installed in a pc since it only scans individual filesurls on demand it does not offer permanent protection for user systems either at virustotal we think of our service as a second opinion regarding the maliciousness of your filesurls

although the detection ratio achieved by the use of multiple antivirus enginesurl scanners is far superior than that offered by just one product these results do not guarantee the harmlessness of a fileurl moreover the aggregate amount of false positives of multiple solutions is higher than that of any individual scanner

currently there is no solution that offers effectiveness in detecting viruses malware and malicious urls you may become a victim of deceitful advertising if you buy such a product under those premises

regarding masternode

masternode is an option i will consider after the reward phase is over and electras pos rewards come from transaction fees only this is because it is uncertain if in the future earning rewards from transaction fees only will give people enough incentive to host a node if in such a state electra loses too many node or if there is a democratic majority who wants the change masternode can be put in place as it may possibly boost the number of node

there are a lot of arguments for and against masternode and each may effect electras unique situation differently i am not sure if there is currently any cryptocurrency in the world which has implemented masternode pos rewards from transaction fees only and therefore it is difficult to foresee how masternode will fare in such a situation

electra
july pm	

regarding objectives

all short term objectives are already completed i aim to complete all medium term objectives within one year i have begun speaking with exchange only recently as i did not think it would have been a smart strategy to apply to an exchange before the hard fork at the current state the price is below satoshi which will make it hard to maintain a bitcoinelectra trading pair in a larger exchange we can get in sure but why would someone buy eca for btc in bittrex when they can go to novaexchange and buy it for ltc we would eventually get delisted for low volume

there are other alternatives i am looking at for exchange such as the earthcoin strategy even though they dont even have an active website and only a day volume on novaexchange they have of total daily volume and market cap how the rest of the volume comes from two chinese exchange they are on focusing on the chinese market seems an interesting choice to increase volume earthcoin does not seem to have done much marketing in chinese either so i am very curious how they reached this kind of volume if there is a chinese speaker in the community i would appreciate help for a chinese market expansion as i do not speak the language it would be good to know the pricecriteria to get into exchange like jubi and btc if there are no chinese speakers i will still research this alternative but it will just take longer

ive asked about the wallets cpu usage before and someone replied that its because staking requires cpu power thats fine but even when the wallet is offline it uses cpu just for being open why is this it should not be the case

well here is a guy who speak chinese ive never register an accountsince you have this require i come i am a user of btc which has a eacearth coin market unfortunately i think it is hard to put an eca market on it because they said they will never put on a NNO altcoin on their web site as far as i know they just put on the eth market a few day ago but dont worry there would be still a lot chinese market to choose btw maybe there would be few chinese people cause this website had been blocked by gfwaka greatgovernment firewall and maybe i can help you to do some translation for website or clientcoinname in your chinese client is wrong

first thing is to check theyre on the blockchain
you can search by transaction id or by address
httpscryptobecomchainelectra

if theyre not on the blockchain delete your copy of the blockchain and resync from zero keep your walletdat safe 

if they are on the blockchain youll need to lodge a support ticket with novexchange

i think something wrong with pos for day there were mined blocks with an estimated time of hours i think it should have been more this is about more times


expectedtime 
weight 
netstakeweight 

 net weight

unsigned int ntargetspacing min block

 hour blocks
 hours blocks
 blocks per hours but usually times


bumbacoin
july am	

are you talking about your own staked blocks 

there are two things you might not be considering

staking is probability based and dependent on network variables expectedtime is only a guide and also fluctuates based on changes in difficulty
and
your staking ability is limited by the amount of staking inputs and their relative maturities


open your wallet go to preferences enable coin control

go to send window select inputs 

this will enable you to see how many individual staking inputs you have note unconfirmed or immature coin will not be visible as they are not eligible for sending yet

i have staking inputs does it change anything
weight is already calculated my actual weight of netweight
i understand that an approximate calculation of time is shown but the difference in times seems to me more than it should
what is the ratio of the blocks to the time you have

what is the estimated time or your weight wallet all the time online




jaerin
july pm	

nope ive staked blocks in the last day


goodhabit
july pm	

the situation with staking is at least confusing i tried to figure out what coin maturity means in the explorer i discovered that most blocks were awarded to a small number of wallets according to the richlist most of them in the top that staked blocks sometimes every hour but the coin day destroyed that serve as base to calculate the reward were in many cases relatively low

at least lower than the million i get under your weight but i still wait since about day since about two day the expected time fluctuates between day

initially i had been assuming that every stake rewards all accumulated points of the staker getting the reward and the counter then is set to zero while large wallets would move to the top rather soon again the changes for smaller wallets to at least get rewards sometimes would be far bigger or at least sooner but as i figured out every block only rewards part of the weight an account actually holds and therefore only reduces the weight very gradually so that large wallets will remain on top for quite a long time this is discouraging for people who are NNO to pos rewards and is likely to undermine goodwill

when i was waiting for my first staking reward ca day with a bit more than mio coin i did some digging with the explorer than still updating my impression autosplit of staking inputs creates to many small input fractions in larger wallets so slowing time to get reward for all and making it particulary difficult for relatively small wallets to get started small in that context mio


goodhabit
july am	
the estimate will come down when i first started it gave me day so just slightly more than years with k coin but it did come down

goodhabit
july am	
unfortunately if my guess of autosplitting slowing down staking is correct

the solution would to have
a generate much more blocks or 
b reward several inputs at once and then automerge them in to larger inputs

but both would require another hardfork 


goodhabit

for me it always worked fast did you send to the right adress did you confirm the email for withdrawels from nova you always have to confirm by clicking a link in an email within hrs or your withdrawel will be canceld but then your coin should be at your nova balance again

it just needs a decent pump a few more exchange a better website and a dev plan

id suggest masternode android and ios light wallets a strategie to get some major retailers on board in several important countries

may be an open end prolongation of the pos stageprobably with lower but still significant reward

could still have more potential than of all the other shitcoin but most likely wont

may i ask how many coin do you stake


goodhabit
august am	
seems the network is recently accepting more stakes by really old inputs even if they are relatively small even below k but the bulk still goes to a few top adresses even if they now also need much more time due to quite a lot of many relatively small inputs broken down by earlier stakings

at least i noticed that the possibility to automerge small inputs seems to exist although i only saw it with inputs of less than k and maturity well over day and not for me have no so old small inputs but i staked a few times when my staking wight was mio now with mio im still waiting

but this is probably because network wight has more than doubled in the meantime so there is still a lag building up

kiddo
august pm	

the dev said is still around and working a page or two back


wklalen
august pm	
electra go to bittrex


goodhabit
august pm	

well it only goes up and down as a result of the method coinmarketcap calculates marketcap

every time a heroinvestor or micropumper spends a fraction of btc buying at the price of the massive sellwall of satoshi the price jumps up

whenever the very few buys at that price drop out of the statistic the price collapses because it then is calculated on the very low price on the ltc market only
both ltc dodge and as well eth and esp markets have prices far below one satoshi

so what a real rise would need pumpersinvestors would have to buy the ltcdogeeth markets at nova up until they reach satoshi level would involve investing btc or about k 

then they could move to another exchange sell the few ecas the transferred to each other at high prices get coinmarketcap to notice the higher price at other exchange with a much higher price on other exchange visible the sellwall at nova might crumble the low volume would be gone and some other people might get attracted to a fast rising coin

but such a move would afford a real investment several btc or several k or euro or whatever that someone is really ready to put at risk


skdsw
august pm	
nice words buy from me for a high price few millions and then i shall buy it back from you 

goodhabit
august pm	
doesnt work if i buy at nova id have to buy the many millions at low price first 

and if we make a private deal somehow it wont be noticed by third parties and thus not influence the public price 

so wha

fvalchiria

goodhabit
august am	
im afraid you misread that was most likely a suggestion and not an announcement

goodhabit
august am	
well the system seems to have a bias to slow rewarding down when a wallet has accumulated sufficient staking weight to get the next block the preference seems to go to the input with the lowest reward as long as this input can still be split in outputsthat is has coin age below somwhere between and day

small rewards keep the weight of the staking wallet high so allowing for higher staking frequenzy and smaller inputs require more blocks

but probably this has gone a bit to far

if and only if the observed possibility to automerge inputs upon reward only considers maturity and not only applies to very small inputs this should iron out eventually but probably somwhere around an average maturity of day


kiddo

thanks for the detailed answer ill try to split my coin in chunks to see what happens

while the little action is disappointing claims about a scam or pump seem unjustified

how can it be a successful scam if practically no one is buying you cant buy cheap on novas ltc doge or eth markets and dump high at satoshi on the btc market because the queue for dumping is so longalmost billion eca or just of total supply otoh that there are still occasionally people buying low quantities at the btc market either means they do no math just dont like to convert their btc in something else first and are looking for something wich is not that clearly an obvious scam like most highly rated coin on nova actually are im not talking of btcltcdoge or ether herebut much of the rest for a pump it looks to meager diletantic the buy wall is to high to overcome it on nova or you would have to really invest about btc so you would have to buyout the minor markets btc would do there and than move to another exchange small quantities allowing the hodl group to mainly buy and sell to each other

so no no scam and not really a pump just a little bit to little activity

considering that stratis is also in cryptobe electra getting the most views there is quite an achievement i am aware there are concerns that i am posting less frequently as electra is working properly at the moment there is less need to do so also note that i am only able to fully work on the project during weekends but despite this have achieved all of electras shortterm goals the immediate goal is still the same get into an exchange where electra can be bought and sold with fiat currency i am in contact with a person who has successfully listed his own altcoin into chinese exchange who i believe can help speed up this process stay patient i am fully determined to achieve this goal

august pm	
still i am having problems with staking it does not go smooth i keep my system on but sometimes it is giving k then the other day k on million coin

am i the only one


kiddo
august am	
staking isnt working that good as i was expecting i stake like millions in chunks of mill and i get like k each day which is not 


goodhabit
august am	
wondering how much of that is just due to my searching for the rules of staking several hits a day certainly 
well lets summarize what i got from digging so much with the explorer

there are by far not all adresses staking

from the top on the richlist

 and arent staking at all about of all eca combined
 combined are staking permanently these accounts are already broken down in to many relatively small segments this has the effect that although they get many blocks they are more and more falling back they get significantly less reward than would be appropriate because they would need more blocks or larger inputs but the bias of the system to slow down still occasionally splits relatively small inputs reward them early so that they have not to big maturity to split while rewarding much larger inputs later maturity is often day

 an account with initially rater large blocks solo mining during bonanza was offline from july th to august on coming online august it started to catch up large blocks with huge maturity therefore many extra coin and only later those large blocks started to get split so this account still gets a lot of reward with relatively few blocks due to still large inputs

 and of which at least if not all are likely to be controlled by the dev started out with inputs of xxl or xxxl size while they stake regularly the lag behind far less than and because they have still on average much larger inputs which reach lower maturity before staking and than usually still split so those accounts suffer less from the slowing down due excess splitting yet so if im correct about those at least partly being the accounts of the dev he would feel this less at least at the moment

generally the network weight is still climbing significantly a clear sign that the lag is increasing making it more an more difficult to get a fair reward

i havent been a able to trace the staking formula although i tried to find it in the source code so im doing guessing from observation only

and to kiddo rearranging the inputs before they stake probably except with very small inputs doesnt help much it just resets the counter to zero

well should be correct the reward formula is coinday x or just plain and simple coinday most adresses i checked got between to of that not because of a different formula but because there are to many inputs waiting for reward and so the network weight is still building up splitting of inputs goes still on although there are already far to many staking inputs imho an average staking time of to day per input would likely be optimal so the network would need about to staking inputs there are certainly many more

but if you get per day you must be a special case so we would have to look at the relevant details for that we would need to no what adress your refering to

the fact that not everybody is staking should not increase reward over time it should just mean that the maximum supply will be reached later

but my question adressed the fact that i couldnt find an account for which your claim is valid over an extended period of time say since august all accounts received clearly less than so you would either have to be a special case or your looking at a to narrow time windowwithout knowing which ecaadress we are talking about i cant check

this is just an unverified claim without knowing his address we cant really know but the claim seems implausible 

actually the reward is calculated correctly for actually more if you include possible compound interest but the intervals are growing the coinage of the average block getting reward goes still up and so goes the network weight which means that you get your reward later and might miss out on compound interest and that smaller wallets will have to wait even longer
so if some people would actually take their wallet offline for a few day this might help reducing network weight but once they go online again they will still get reward according to their coinage that has been building up offline that of course is not actually what is the intend of pos

dream on the wall at one satoshi is still standing strong billion eca their has been an outlier at the doge market but someone probably made a typo and overpayed so that there was a short time when the dogeeca price was actually over satoshi but for very small quantities only

just checked again only half of the billion eca is on sale for satoshi the other half hoping for higher prices so the wall has come down just a little bit

maybe i am too unlucky and i get smaller amounts about the maybe adamd can show his calculaions or how he got that amount of intrest about the offline acumulating coin age i saw many coin have this implemented so is not the end of the world i wonder if dev wallet is staking or not

goodhabit
august pm	
definitely is on the richlist actually was the NNO premine address see note a

it was reorganized on july when on the list was created as a spinoff starting with just one huge block

 actually has a very similar structure huge blocks was as well reorganized on july but the source of the coin is more complicated but this could easily be a address of the dev as well if he participated in mining during the bonanza solo or via pool

if all of them are different addresses in the same wallet this would explain why they perform quite a bit better than average large weight in the network far larger inputs than average so staking frequently but not very often but getting large rewards but actually starting to fall behind as well now with inputs getting smaller due to frequent splitting

note a this address is still used by coinmarketcap to calculate the difference between total supply and circulating supply they just wanted to exclude the premine from the circulating supply but as this address is staking as well and the amount is due to the aforementioned reorganization much lower than the NNO premine that doesnt really make any sense anymore


electra
august pm	

i can confirm that i am participating in the staking process not everyday but often due to the low share of the premine and frequent splitting the impact should be low even when staked the premine share should remain within the range

i took part in the bonanza with a medium range graphics card and generated about eca which is kept in a seperate wallet

the value in coinmarketcap causes electras value to appear only about higher than reality as the premined eca will eventually be transferred back to the address given to coinmarketcap i do not want to bother gliss about it he has other coin on his list to worry about

why are you staking the premined coin dont you think thats a bit unethical and misleading based on the quoted premined amount on the announcement page is it possible for you to list all of the addresses where the premined coin are held on the announcement page the community shouldnt have to do investigative work to try and find where the premined coin are located this coin has potential but the hiding and moving around of the premined coin just seems shady and has an unnecessary negative effect on the future and value of the coin

august pm	

i am staking in order to cover the initial and possibly future investments i havewill put up for this project from my own capital examples include exchange applications coinmarketcap bounty block explorer cointelegraph and outsourced node hosting for the first three months the premine was not sold or claimed at all for any of these investments my personal costs add up to more than which is about eca with the current market valuation rather than claim part of the premine to myself and sell it in exchange i have preferred to get my initial investment back through staking as i believed it will cause less unrest among stakeholders and also because i want to play a part in moving the blockchain forward if stakeholders prefer me to claim part of the premine to cover my costs rather than stake this is also possible

i announced that the premine would be moved into other adresses in a previous forum post it was not hidden all transaction and staking history can also be clearly viewed in the block explorer

these are the addresses where the premined coin are held

last i heard cryptopia was btc to list it on there but it is a decent exchange i would say that it seems like a good choice if the developer is looking to get exposure for the coin

the problem ultimately will be whether it will repeat what we see on nova which is just people dumping everything they have into the market and saturating it

we need to get above sat in order to probably be taken seriously

why is getting listed on wikipediaorg even on the roadmap

posw is releasing their NNO website next month you should definitely consider adding eca to it for autostaking



goodhabit
september am	
just some observations doesnt look really good

dev activity is very low doesnt even care to have control of his own software

the actual wallet hardfork was released by a different dev who put it on his own github repositiory the dev electra never cared to copy the wallet to the official electra site on github once the the link to the bumbacoin repository was deleted there was no working link anymore some day later a user who had saved a NNO copy created a NNO link on github a few day later bumbacoin shared a link to a saved copy of the wallets on his private google drive but instead of copying this files to the electra gitub or any other webaddress under his control the dev only updated the links on the announcement page so the files are still not under his control but on webaddresses under someone elses control even third party googledrive addresses

there are technical issues

while staking is working more or less properly and blocks are found regularly this is only more or less the calculation of the staking reward annual is correct if you include compound interest it could even be more

but the splitting of inputs and a somehow inbuilt bias of the staking algorithm to reward those inputs in a staking wallet that receive relatively small rewards certainly as well with the intention to create a sufficient supply of staking inputs has made the staking process difficult for smaller wallets they are crowded out as the biggest wallets still have a very huge share of the network weight because many of their inputs are waiting for reward for more than day by now so smaller wallets small meaning here everyone with mio electra are only seldom staking most of the rewards earned by addresses holding relatively few electra like just a few k ore few millions are almoust certainly secondary addresses in larger wallets some of those adresses seem to belong to coinmarketwallet

there seems to be the possibility of automerger of smallvery old inputs but i have observed this only with very small inputs and it might well be that all of them are on the coinmarketwallet so maybe they run a slightly adjusted wallet

since the last hardfork there are only about blocks found every day and not as in the op and so the time to reward all blocks is even longer

total coin created between july th and today september th are million expected would be billion day would be billion so only about this of course was mainly due to the fact that less than of all coin have ever been staking if more would have been staking the crowding out of smaller wallets would of course have been worse

on the technical side you could of course state that due to this slower staking the pos stage will take longer like years and thus the dev does have time to come up with a solution for the time once the billion coin have been generated as there are barely any transaction beside staking and almost all of them are only stakers or exchange reorganising their wallet or people sending coin to or from exchange there cant be an incentive for going the chain running once you would switch to fees only unless their has been a rapid and very strong adoption of electra as a means of payment and even than only if you can get the electra price up to about or at least 

actually the share of staking coin has gone significantly down in recent weeks probably as low as around as many large stakers have fully or partly decamped moved their coin to exchange and tried to dump them otoh there have only been a few larger moves the other way

as a result of these changes the market price has significantly dropped and the sell wall has gone up

not only are there billion electra on offer at nova against bitcoin of which billion for one satoshi recently a wall started to go up at the litecoin market actually there are more than billion electra on offer there and even on the doge market more than million on sale so about of all electras are on offer on novaexchange another ca million are on sale on coinmarket and of course most of the sales that actually happened didnt result in the buyers shifting large amounts to staking wallets so they either still hold them passively on the exchange or put them in NNO sales orders doesnt really make sense as long as there is no positive price movement and yes about of all coin are held at adresses that showed no movement at all since the last hardfork did they miss the update or just lost interest well i suspect that the top adress on the richlist might be novaexchange coldwallet but who knows

but unless their is much more activity likely including an active hodling group and more support forby the dev or a dev team it pretty much looks like a dying coin 

unfortunately this didnt help smaller wallets the network is still going up as now most blocks go to large wallets with small blocks some of those that decamped actually had very large blocks thus needing not that many blocks for reward and thus speeding up

the latest links that were provided for the wallets are from my personal google drive account not bumbacoin i can upload these to other download locations if people wish i used bumbacoin github link in the forum before to give him credit for the NNO wallets he created the deletion of the link by bumbacoin did catch me by surprise and i put up my own links as fast as i could

despite electra having the issues you mention i do not believe they are serious enough for another fork in the shortterm however this is my personal opinion electra is larger than myself and if the majority of the network wishes to have these updates implemented and release their own version of a wallet i will support it after i am satisfied with testing

to myself personally the fact that electra is listed on multiple exchange has a block explorer working wallets and an active websiteforum thread is just as important if someone NNO joins the network i try to ensure that they will always have access to live uncensored information about electra

while staking is working more or less properly and blocks are found regularly this is only more or less the calculation of the staking reward annual is correct if you include compound interest it could even be more
after my calculations stacking sucks not even is now for my million eca bag i get something between k and k everyday sometimes day till i hit a block but never above k i think i must stake billion anyway is not about the reward here the problem is the developement very long term this means years considering implementing masternode not implementing just considering




goodhabit
september pm	
well with something million eca you should get kday on average but reward is calculated on coinday of each staking input thus if a large part of your coin are still waiting for reward it will take longer until you achieve a better quota but not necessarily a higher amount in the wallet as there are to many small staking inputs on the network average coin age to get reward is still going up it takes longer until you get a block but as you or your stakinginput will have accumulated more coinday reward will be higher but often the system selects inputs that receive relatively few coin and lets those that are due more get even older thus accumulating more future reward if many user would manually reduce their number of staking inputs by manually merging smaller blocks that recently staked in to larger inputs it might speed up but dont manually shift older staking inputs around because this would destroy coinday without getting reward und thus destroying expected reward

update

i am getting these types of questions as pms also so i have updated the getting started page in the official website to avoid confusion the guide now provides stepbystep instructions for pos rather than pow view here httpelectraprojectweeblycomgettingstartedhtml


i have also recived a reply from coinomi which one user requested and i have shared the contents with you below answering these questions seem to be the only requirement to get integrated therefore i will proceed with the application


hi

terrible apologies for the late response the whole sector is experiencing tremendous growth and were scaling up as fast as we can to meet demand

to be able to estimate the effort needed for the integration we request the info below i know some questions were already answered but to keep things organized im leaving all the questions from our questionnaire please reply after each question in a NNO line

 are you a core team member
 
 the official website of your project
 
 the official code repository
 
 coin ticker symbol

 the coinmarketcap entry

 
please answer with as much detail as possible

 
is your coin a derivative work of an existing project
 
if yes
 
what is the NNO codebase you have used
 
have you modified the block and transaction serialization formats
 
have you modified the block proof of work hash function
 
have you modified the block id hash function as is reported in the rpc
 
have you modified the transaction id hash function
 
have you modified the cryptographic signature algorithm in any way

have you modified the standard scripts for sending receiving or in general

have modified the script language in any way if applies

kind regards
coinomi support

hello all

 what is min age

 so i was wondering what the block size should be for good staking

like k k or more 

 any help thank you


goodhabit
october pm	

 hours
much more

minimum should not be below million per block smaller blocks will get reward eventually but it can take a long time if the walletsize is large small blocks with get reward eventually if the block size is not to uneven but to many small blocks already slowed the staking process down significantly if you start with only one very large block it would autosplit every time after getting reward in two blocks of equal size thus creating more inputs but only if you hit a block in less than day if you start with one large block million would be good to get autosplitting started if you have significantly less several blocks of about equal size should work out ok but as network weight is already quite high wallets that hold less than mio will take quite a bit of time to hit the first block and even smaller ones will need very much time

when inputs of less than k coin hit a block they are usually part of an address with significantly more coin several small inputs and if addresses with less than mio hit a block they are almost always part of a larger wallet

there are actually between billion coin staking and cummulated coin day network weight fluctuates between billion coin day depending if some wallets are temporary offline with an average of just blocks a day this means that the average block is already day old and will usually stake later after day or more if we divide billion by this means that about million coin day need to get reward per block just to avoid that the network weight increases further and thus increases the average time for reward even more million cdd million coin so all blocks smaller million actually slow the staking process down

i agree personally i think this coin if played right has potential im buying holding and staking network height is pretty high right now will have to buy more before i see much return in staking i think


justme
october am	
this is true staking is very hard for low bag holders im staking near million coin and i get like k eca every day or sometimes on day which is not the stated in the coin specifications anyway i dont stake them anymore because i can even pay for electricity to keep the wallet running

october pm	
saw the guys today the growth of coin the whole day goes up

difference between pow and pos with focus on electracoin

all cryptocurrency need a sufficient number of full node that are computers who have an up to date copy of the entire database and are mostly online and can therefore communicate with other notes and participate in the validating of the blockchain trough consensus

if they are truly decentralized they need an incentive for people to provide hardware energy and network connections and therefore each block found that is added to the blockchain receives some NNOly generated coin as block reward the node that adds a block is called miner

if the coin are somewhat valuable there could be many people that try to mine them and thus not only will the maximum coin supply be reached soon if there is a maximum coin supply but to many blocks in short sequence might create problems to reach consensus among the node

therefore a threshold is needed to decide who can get mine the next block classical coin like bitcoin or litecoin use proof of work pow to decide who can next mine under pow potential miners need to perform some additional mathematical operations to qualify thus the threshold is called difficulty

if a miner qualifies and gets a block there is at least one transaction NNO coin are generated and are credited on the miners address if there are additional transaction there might as well be transaction fees those are added to the blockreward the NNO coin that are now NNO at the miners address are kept together as one input but kept separate from earlier or later inputs

according to he uxtomodel unspent transaction output set each address can have separate piles of coin that are separated from each other called inputs and if you send coin from this address you can only send entire inputs inputs are always either spent or unspent if you send less than the total of one input to an address the change goes either back as a NNO smaller input to the NNO address if this is set as default change address or to a separate NNOly generated address within the same wallet

now if a pow coin becomes very valuable like bitcoin the difficulty has to be raised exponentially to keep blocktime stable thus raising the threshold very high so to mine a bitcoin block you have to waste a lot of energy and hardware to qualify for a block and thus bitcoinmining has become expensive and highly centralized

so to avoid this problem proof of stake pos is a different method to determine who can mine the next block a different threshold to qualify coinholders need to keep a certain amount of coin unspent not moved for some time

the wallet that runs a full node calculates staking weight by multiplying the inputs in all the addresses it controls with their respective age coinday broadcasts this to other node the sum of all the broadcasts forms the network weight comparing network weight with staking weight of each wallet the network determines which wallet will mine the next block the wallet then selects one of its inputs generates the NNO coin for he block reward transaction and in a second transaction resets the staking input sets it to spent and creates a NNO input unspent out of the former staking input block reward evtl transaction fees

there are two main forms of pos block reward fixed reward or proportional reward with fixed reward as in pow each block gets an equal amount of NNO coin so to optimize your wallet to get as many blocks as possible makes sense more blocks more reward

with proportional reward the amount of NNOly generated coin per block varies it is calculated as a proportion of the coin day destroyed of the input that gets the reward that is number of coin multiplied with coin age multiplied or divided by a fix factor thus the inputs that dont get reward now are likely to get reward later and if they get reward later their reward will be bigger more coinday

electra is after a short pow stage a full pos coin with proportional reward reward is coinday of the input getting the block divided by of equals annual
so there is not really an incentive to have many small inputs and get as many blocks as possible the rewards per block just get smaller and if the network uses more blocks to reward all staking inputs it takes longer for everyone to earn the expected reward

if the proportional block reward is high enough like with electra it would for the staker make sense to have as large inputs as possible or just one stake rarely but get reward for the full amount as this reward time would on average be earlier than with small blocks the staker can get more compound interest

staking the same addresses on multiple wallets might result in earlier getting a block and thus in less reward per block but certainly not in more reward you cant get reward for the same input more than once the coin are not in the wallet they are on a given address on the blockchain the wallet holds only the keys to the address so if an address is controlled by multiple wallets each wallet will notice that the input has been redeemed spent

now some specifics for electra

each input starts counting for stake earning weight hours after its creation block reward is of the coinday redeemed that includes the first hours each input that earns reward within the first day after its creation is split at output including block reward in NNO inputs of equal size there is a possibility to automerge inputs at reward but this has been observed only for very small inputs all inputs that get reward are rewarded for the full coinage irrespective of how long the wallet has been offline there is no maximal coin age to get reward afaik

there seems to be an inbuild bias towards slowing down reward frequently smaller inputs that get less reward or relatively young inputs that can still be split are rewarded earlier than those within the same wallet that would get more reward this was probably designed that way to create a sufficient supply of staking node and keep the network weight high

some of the best performers among stakers seem to have only a small number of inputs and keep their wallet offline for some time day this tendency seems to have increased recently so that the network weight actually declinedat least for some time this tactic of course runs against the purpose of staking because it reduces the number of node that are actually active

this is a field where i really see a necessity of some technical improvement reduce maximum age for splitting eg day introduce auto merging of older inputs eg day and exclude inputs that are mostly offline from reward eg all inputs with more than day coin age a transition period of a few thousand blocks would be required here a further area of technical improvement is the block time while the op states that the target is day we rarely get although many inputs are expecting reward it seems that there is a flaw in the difficulty adjustment formula which increases fast but decreases slow and thus often leads to large distances between blocks up to one hour here id suggest to keep the adjustment for every block but not calculated from the last block but from a rolling average lets say blocks one hour back

can you prove this i am staking millions eca for months so i should get like millions from stake in eca millions and i have like millions after months so something is wrong maybe the big holders get and it compensate 



goodhabit
october am	
well staking reward only works properly since the second hard fork july th so months but older inputs can still get the full reward if they didnt stake yet
but with calculation months day x million coin day expected reward ca 

to verify if your claim is correct i would have to know your ecaaddress to look it up with the explorer no risk involved in publishing it here

bumbacoin
october am	
the best scenario for a fixed pos network is to have a high network difficulty created by many inputs
so yes the current code does encourage the wallet to split and slow down rewards but as you say leaving your wallet offline for day gets around this

adjusting wallet combinesplitage thresholds is relatively easy and only requires compiling NNO clients
its unclear whether that would actually positively effect the network as it might end up reducing difficulty and make it more susceptible to attack

reducing max stake age is a hard fork as is changing difficulty adjustment
also a hard fork is changing to a fixed reward to encourage constant staking with many inputs

i quite like fixed reward this also has the effect of reducing effective inflation rate over time
ie current inflation rate is which equates to year although the real effect of pos is not actually 
converting that to a constant reward of coinblock gives roughly the same apparent inflation rate for now but as the coin supply increases the value of that reward decreases

difficulty adjustment will never be perfect there are many attempts at getting the perfect system
but especially when the network is prone to large fluctuations in stake weight wallets offline for much time it will continue to vary widely


bumbacoin
october am	
another way to help with connnecting to the network is to use inbuilt irc
youll need to add
code
irc
to your electracoinconf

on startup yr client will then connect to irc and join a dedicated electracoin chatroom to look for other clients

i have no idea how to compile but if anyone has the github links and can walk me through it i will happily try compiling

thanks

for those who cant get there wallet to sync dont forget to create the electraconf file in the appdata folder for electra and add the nodelist given in the op
i wondered why it was not syncing and noticed there was no conf file present in that folder
so i created it and added all node to it now syncing is lighting fast and almost ready to add my coin to the wallet

aditionally if this dosent work either you can create a shortcut of the electraqtexe go to shortcuts properties and on the target field add confelectraconf without quotes run the shortcut

statement

electra does not have any involvement with the following ico httpselektracoincomaffiliatesfecfedfceeddbe



announcement

added community facebook and twitter links to op



starlng
october am	
as i promised a small manual to build electra wallet under ubuntu

i used a fresh virtual machine with ubuntu let me know if you have issues in later versions well try to figure something out

so first i added the bitcoin repository to install libdb because
quote
ubuntu and later have packages for libdbdev and libdbdev but using these will break binary wallet compatibility and is not recommended

so the instructions are

code
sudo addaptrepository ppabitcoinbitcoin
sudo aptget update

sudo aptget upgrade

sudo aptget install git buildessential libssldev libdbdev libdbdev libboostalldev libminiupnpcdev qtdefault qtqmake qtbasedevtools qttoolsdevtools

mkdir src
cd src
git clone httpsgithubcomelectraelectra
cd srcelectra

qmake
make

i assumed that user would like to build a gui wallet so i included qt libs

after the make command finished you will have the electraqt executable file which is th electra coin wallet you can copymove this file to any location

code
electraqt

at the first run you will most likely see an error message just start the wallet again

and dont forget to create the electraconf file in electra directory and add some node somehow it is not created automatically

i would download this on my windows pc but my c drive is running low on storage so i downloaded the mac version and the instruction are for windows only right


starlng
december am	
i bet the instructions are the same for any os if you download and run a precompiled wallet of course the only difference is the location of electras blockchain and electraconf
in linux theyre located in your home directory like homeuserelectra
im not too familiar wit mac but electra should have similar location there

got some coin confirmed in the wallet spendable

hi all

NNO win wallet is almost completed now gui design left we will customize our win wallet with customized button and interface that our members feel special among many other wallets sync problem is over recent blockcahin included yes size increased to mb but depending on your connection speed you become ready in minutes once the total package is finished we will run a totalvirus scan as well

meanwhile our volume started increasing on coinmarket even at doge markets we are in top sometimes no but unfortunately as cmc has no doge market links in calculation this doesnt reflect to our real volume you can check yourself all those by navigating

maybe you have checked our twitter announcement we made our first agreement with the first online merchant which is accepting eca as optional payment we will increase amount of mercants in time we beleive that eca has a real future and this will be proven by choise of several online businesses and user

soon you will see some good volume increase and NNO big investors by eca details we cant share here much but stay tuned

cheers

i was having no connections with the wallet so i grabbed the addnode from novaexchange
now its syncd up in less than five minutes great network 


these should be added to the op

i really like the or less eca fees for transfers i see vision in the roadmap that could be compelling for long term investors too also cant wait to see this listed on more exchange


electra
december pm	
it is in the op it is listed under node i put the link instead of each individual node because the are a lot of node and the link is in realtime


electra

announcement


a NNO exchange is opening soon called next exchange they are currently allowing people to vote for coin they want added there is no fee or signup required to vote and not much competition just go to the link provided below and click upvote about votes seems to guarantee entry which is easily achievable with the size of the electra community each person gets one vote daily

httpsnextexchangefeatureupvotecomsuggestionselectraeca


remember that every exchange electra is listed on will add value to your holdings if you own eca it is in your interest to vote daily

when eca was first listed on exchange there were only coin available circulating supply so if someone bought a small fraction like for this resulted in unrealistic price per coin like in this example once coin supply increased very fast as planned price per coin crashed hard but now it seems to recover

this coin is going nowhere as long as the dev is not ready to pay for good exchange for electra to be listed according to him he said this early this week i have spoken with coinexchangeio most top exchange ask for btc for a listing prices are insanely high at the moment

he thinks its too expensive at the moment but the fact is the listing cost is going higher due to a high number of coin flooding into the market

 billion electra coin minedcirculating with no good exchange i will check back when hes ready to pay for listing but for now there are so many better coin especially after the minicrash that occurred yesterday good luck people

they can probably list eca on cobinhood it looks like a promising platform and nice ui still a lot of kinks though and not many other trades going on yet since it just opened im sure listing there would be cheap

here are some updates 

 we fixed the conf file auto synch issue for mac wallet we will release it in day
 we have a minor bug fix on win wallet this will be also released
 our NNO website we work on it and hope to complete by end of this month
 we have some ongoing discussion with big exchange as well but first nextexchange will list eca for this we are preparing some files we hope to get listed during early january
 soon we will start updating the github repository as well

even today team worked hard to provide some updates we try to handle several channels at the same please dont blame us why this or that is not there we still prepare you cant imagine but we sometimes reply to questions like what is wallet address so please contribute us to explain about electra projects and be patience more until we sort everything better we could leave the existing website design and only put more content but we think that electra community deserves best always

can anyone explain how long the waiting time is for staking rewards i already asked in telegram been running the wallet for day now and it still states that it will take day before receiving rewards


rimtu
december pm	

if i withdraw some eca from my wallet wil the staking process start all over again


rimtu
december pm	

i guess it depends on amount of coin you stake

i mine every h in averege with mil coin

finnovatienl
december pm	

but how long did it take to get the first reward and what happens if you withdraw some eca


cryptoneet
december pm	

you have to wait hours for coin to mature depends how many you have


goodhabit
december pm	

coin maturity staking symbol turning green is reached exactly hours after first deposit when you get first reward aka mine your first block depends on how many coin you have and how many other coin are staked by someone else thus the function of your weight vs network weight

if you withdraw some eca it depends you can only spend whole inputs stacks of coin but if you send them in several lots you should manually select the input that is closest to the amount you want to send then only this position is reset and the change starts from zero all the other positions remain unaffected

kgroth
december pm	
is this from the eca wallet or from coinmarket

thanks


goodhabit
december pm	

the above is if you are staking with your own ecaqtwallet your system

if your leaving your coin at coinmarket it doesnt matter what you do coinmarket collects all the staking rewards that have gone to addresses in the coinmarket wallet that of the exchange not the local accounts of their individual customers and distributes them every hours proportionally among all the customers having balances at the time of the distribution normally after pm utc your share is proportional to the number of coin you hold at that moment and not of the average during this period

due to the high transaction volume on coinmarket in the last few day the time the coin actually rest at a given address has likely much declined and thus the share of coin staked at coinmarket might be comparatively low compared to hodlers thus the actual reward distributions are relatively low compared to earlier times with very little trade and transfer activity

install the wallet import the private key from your paperwallet let it rescan and then you can either keep it there staking or transfer to coinmarket

madmac

go to the console and write importprivkey your key that will do the trick


digerati
december pm
i just discovered the console by going to debug and imported the private key with the command line you provided

however the wallet was not in sync i read that there was a NNO wallet installed the NNO wallet but it crashed while opening so i tried reinstalling the old wallet with the same crashing results

i also tried to install homebrew and wine to run the windows version but it could not find electracoinexe in system directory

im pretty much not going anywhere so far



electradollar
december pm
electra is a very cheap coin you can easily buy around to milion coin and sooner or later this coin will go up to between dollar and you just made around dollar this coin is a coin for sure and if it goes down you only lost around dollar
the upside potential off this coin is just to much to not invest 



over just today so far i expect this to go up to usd in the next week
and by the end of januar it will be around usd




digerati
december pm
i was able to remove the hidden electra files in the system library folder and the application did not crash the wallet is still out of sync i read that it needs tor to connect i remember that when i have the android wallet for another crypto

sweep or import from eca paper wallet

download the mac desktop wallet let the wallet sync by leaving the application open for as long as minutes to clear thee outofsync message then go to help debug window then click on the console button on the top type in importprivkey privatekeyhere paper with the quotes close the desktop wallet then go to terminal app or command prompt and type applicationselectraqtappcontentsmacoselectraqt rescan

then that will reopen the mac desktop wallet and your contents of the paper wallet are there the instructions hopefully be similar it just that the file path would be slightly different depend on the windows os

what does it mean



electradollar
january pm
for staking electra coin need to rest for a minimum of hours in your wallet so if all your coin are just NNO in the wallet if you have recently rearranged all the coin in your wallet there are no coin mature so you are not actually staking in this case please wait hours and the coin will be mature and ready for staking



knatseb

ohh okey got it thank you very much 


blueyozakurabtc

ive seen a few threads stating that the nist algorithm is more energy efficient than other algorithms such as equihash with this being used as part of the reason of using this particular algo

is there any detail or evidence that this is the case or how this shows itself in general mining my gpus are running at similar temps using the nist algo plus im power limiting anyway due to high electricity prices in my area

rubbish they do a great job for huge amounts of otherwise shitcoin and let them stake them there most people are not even able to install a simple wallet to do that so give them some kudos great little exchange

also they just went down unannounced due to high traffic

great or not great coinmarket cannot handle all volume on their platform and mainly on eca trading pairs i think this is the main reason why we need a bigger exchange for eca

it mean when you will continue stacking time to obtain reward should be smaller and smallerdepend net difficulite sometimes can raise and some day you will stack eca

when will be day to chance is big

electra i congratulate you for the popularity in the last day about a week ago i bought about half a million ea when it was around satoshi and i still keep it but not just as with coinmarket is there any NNOs for entry into other exchange there is nextexchange NNOs but there is not even a more functional platform

im sorry i dont quite understand im under the impression that it currently just takes a few minutes for the expected reward time to get from k day to day is this correct and if so how do i claim my rewardhow long does it take until i receive that reward

coinmarket was forced to switch to fast servers because they cannot keep up with the demand of electra coin which reached million usd in volume once electra will be listed on a decent exchange such as coinmarket cryptopia or kucoin prices will explode btw were listed on exchange already nextexchange is surely in the pipeline hoping for more updates as soon as possible

from the about section on the coin homepage

through pos you can earn and increase your investments by annually until the total circulating supply reaches the maximum supply

so what incentive do people have to keep coin after the maximum supply is reached and how will NNO blocks continue to be added to the blockchain or will the coin just die once the maximum supply is reached

your website is missing some very basic features like a whitepaper and a dev these are big nonos and a warning sign to all considering purchasing this coin

the staking wallets will earn from the tx fees after pos im sure i read that on the website somewhere mr fud

all i hear everywhere is whitepaper whitepaper what a load of balls

whitepapers dont mean diddly squat




knatseb

no they didnt in fact i kinda like cms somehow hehehe tons of shitty coin but seemd to me like a serious place to trade i was doing it myself for some weeks got good profits on it just couldnt handle elctras rising electras volume was like x above the second coin they didnt expect it and if we take a look total cryptocurrency volume has reached the billion usd and most exchange are getting laggy like biftinex everytime iota reaches a lh limit bittrex having issues with wallets kukoin lately cryptopia have had its downtimes these last couple day binance also im talking about bigones poloniex has hold the massive increase of investors very well i dont like poloniex actually but i have to give them the credit about having good servers another big exchange house that you can recommend or im missing

psd i remember my first investment with electra m coin wih btc tt sold it when i doubled it and well why didnt i keep the half when i doubled it right had to spend lot more for a million coin but cant complaint im staking and i wont made the same mistake again
now that i remember i bought btcs on embers at satoshis now its x higger on cryptopia good to know that i couldnt sell it xdd

do you think eca will cross end of january no NNOs about NNO exchange anybody has any NNOs about when they are planning for NNO exchange


denyboyjanuary pm

eca its going to reach in the next months and it can go to before why because this year crypyocurrency are going to explode when market cap get to trillion its going to be on every channel NNOs in the world and its going to atract the attention on real big whales you have to understand that most of billionares and trillionares are old people who dont understand tehnology meny dont even know how to use smartphone or use facebook so not only that they dont understand chryptoworld but a small market doesnt get their attention also but trillion market cap get attention to everybody this year its going to be boom so dont get enthusiastic when eca get to be ready sell something but keep the coin for you are not going to be sorry people sell their coin now for a few kkk they are going to regret in about one year when they are going to remember that they had eca coin sell it for almost nothing and they could be millionares remember trillion market cap its a door to opportunities

we are at the end of the innovator stage and rushing headlong into the early adopter stage

you dont have wait for your wallet to sync before sending coin to it i am correct here once you download your wallet you are set the addresses you create from that wallet are yours make sure to back up your wallet and save your encryptedpasswordyou will be abole to find this in your appdata folder safe the dat file on an external device preferable separate devices and stored in different locations not a bank vault

ouch from being a top coin to in less than day thats gotta sting

sorry but yall shoulda listened to me


rimtu
january pm
that is only because coinmarketcapcom get its statistics from coinmarketcom and coinmarketcom is down because it couldnt handle the mil daily volume

eca is being traded normally on coinhouseeu with daily volume of k which is not that bad the current price is satoshi and this shows that there is still good demand for the coin

so if you consider this price with all the thing you have mentioned no whitepaper what happens when max supply is reached if the project continues to be developed the price could be significantly higher

if the coin were scam it would be dead months ago

and devs promised whitepaper in q so we shouldnt wair for too long to see

im posting this as a buyer beware

eca wallet filled with virsues
only place you can buy eca you will get robbed

the eca dev sent me to

httpscoincontrolcom

to buy and sell eca i sent coin over and they dont show up chat room is filled with people talking like surprise surprise coinmarket with everyone asking where their deposit is

then they say show shorry and your stuck with no funds

there are only other coin being trades on httpscoincontrolcom and thats a coincontrol coin and eca the other coin are the btc ltc ect

so isnt it funny that one exchange closes down coinmarket and another shady one opens up coincontrol

isnt it funny how the dev of eca are telling everyone to go buy at coincontrol

isnt it funny coincontrol is only selling coin theirs and eca

i think the eca dev set up both exchange to manipulative price and dump coin on NNO comers

i have eca and i want to sell it all i want nothing to do with its infected wallet and shady exchange

dont buy eca you will be stuck with nowhere to sell it

you have been warnedbuyer beware

doctorlw
january am
wow some not so bright people in this thread

the eca wallet like nearly every other qt wallet can trigger false flags for trojan virus there is no virus in the wallet even if there were a virus it would have nothing to do with coinmarketcom going down

however eca did crash coinmarketcom because at the time it was the most popular coin on the site by a large margin and the only site where it was available it drove huge amounts of traffic to the site and the site has now been trying to create NNO infrastructure to meet demand it also drew attention to itself and cm was victim of ddos attacks things cm probably should have been prepared for but it was a low tier exchange in a budding market this sort of thing is to be expected if you havent noticed all exchange are having this problem now due to the flood of NNO blood into the cryptosphere if you havent noticed most exchange have had to stop NNO user registrations for this reason

eca and to a lesser extent colx drove a huge amount of traffic to coinmarket and put them on the map they know this and are actively trying to capitalize on it they havent run off with anyones coin if they did they wouldnt even bother keeping up the charade they have too much to lose establishing themselves as a legit exchange

finally id like some of what the conspiracy theorist above who thinks eca and coinmarket are in it together is smoking please that was about as far away from a logical explanation as one can get

electra


january am
i want to clarify to the community the status of our current exchange

status of exchange eligible for coinmarketcap

next exchange confirmed they will add electra but not yet open
cryptopia their native coin required to list NNO coin called dot has been bought by our community members and electra will be added as soon as possible currently cryptopia is having issues with their own platform which is causing some delay
yobit they have added an electra market but it has not opened to trading yet no clear NNOs on when it will open
coinmarket website down due to server updates removed from coinmarketcap


status of exchange currently not eligible for coinmarketcap

coinhouse has an active electra market but not eligible for coinmarketcap due to fees
bitafex and coincontrol has an active electra market but not eligible for coinmarketcap
novaexchange electra market active but due to ongoing takeover depositswithdrawals are disabled


there are a few other applications we are also waiting on when yobit cryptopia ne or coinmarket activate their electra markets they will be added to coinmarketcap

good job coinmarketcam f you right back

ive been on many website talking about coincam and nobody has ever posted a screenshot of the site working or showing any personal wallets if one lucky person does show it he or she is probably on the scam as well only the scammers will have the happy go lucky the site is the best in the world and gonna come back just watch attitude the people who have lost control ever their coin without advance notice like novaexchange have a slightly different experience

is there a roadmap


goodhabit
january am
a few first trades were made on crytobridge at elevated price but no it stabilized around sat the same level as coinhouseeu or coincontrol


goodhabit
january am
 if your wallet synced you can ignore or delete the config file the one you have to back up is the walletdat or your private keys




futureballer
january pm
coinmarket exchange is up or so it would appear but i cant log into my account it continual to say we sent you an email click on it has anyone else had this trouble has anyone been able to access their ecas on this exchange


johndoe

it seems that their wallets are coming back online im guessing their servers are recovering slowly as well


tuxracer
january pm
would not get my hopes up that coinmarket will be fully fuctioning before monday its weekend and most people work less during the weekend positive sign that things are slowly starting to function


deepterrfici
january pm
any word on when coinmarket will be back up so much eca lost there im wondering if people refused to buy eca until coinmarket unlocks everyones money would that get things moving in the right direction


goodhabit
january pm
no real NNOs afaik the occasional mainpage with a non working log in and some may be online wallets are not really a change since many day and im pretty unsure if not most of them are just copies out of webcaches


dallas


january am
that is exactly what you are looking at is webcaches for now on if a coin isnt on one of the real exchange that makes dev responsible im not investining in that coin the exchange the devs complain about are the exchange that make them act responsibly and they dont like that if you look at the top coin on coinmarketcapcom non of their devs complain about exchange now ask yourselfwhy is that

dvsrydin
january am
it will be interesting to see how this plays out i mean this week has been a really weird one for alts lot of red maybe it will be blessing that eca was down in the shadows during this time who really knows

i hope coinmarket there are two ss people gets back up and running because i have other coin just sitting they they better be staking and that would be a huge loss to several coin communities if those user lost out on those coin


coinmaster
anuary am
is it possible after cm total supply gets reduced as cm coin are burried with cm if in caseis that possible



denyboyjanuary am
i see eca its back on coinmarketcapcom with NNO markets 





delphinus
january am
youve given up hope on cm i still expect they will return in the near future

goodhabit
january pm
well if they wouldnt come online again you dstill have to identify the addresses where coin are on coinmarket and if you wanted to burn them youd need a hardfork to disable those coin from ever being spent again if they couldnt be burned successfully there is no other way to prevent that they would eventually been cashed out

otoh it seems that many of their wallets seem online again and that cm is actually or was a few hours ago participating in ecastaking

about coinhouse i withdraw some btc couple times but but every time i write support ticket because of suspect state so for me withdraws are manuallast withdraw not come since day

january pm
update regarding exchange and coinmarketcap

electra has been added to cryptobridge which is a modern decentralized exchange and one i personally believe has good potential to grow

electra has been readded to coinmarketcap using the markets from coinhouseeu and cryptobridgeorg the current circulating supply on coinmarketcap is wrong it should be about billion not million therefore electras true valuation is still around not i am speaking with coinmarketcap to get this fixed as soon as possible

thank you it is good to see more liquidity in electra thank you for all you do

if all eca on in the cm wallet is stolen what will happen what can we or the team do for that a part of my eca is still there



isle of groestljanuary pm
eca will be over if cm does not come back
electra devs cant wash their hands of it
too much eca is on there and the NNO investors will not put up with coin being stolen
if you comment like this on electra discord ultor a total prick whoreclown will ban you for expressing basic freethought

hello electra team i have got a question
 why still we cant withdraw eca from coinmarket

january pm
electra wont be over any more than bitcoin was after mtgox should coinmarket not come back sorry for your potential loss but dont try to place blame on the electra team for your misfortune and mistakes electra had announced upcoming exchange NNO wallets NNO website and roadmap before cm went down electra didnt lead you to trust coinmarket you left your coin on there and if you researched investing in crypto at all you kNNO that you dont actually have your coin until theyre in your own personal wallets

when i found eca and had researched all i could i saw massive potential gains and have made them even with today corrections with the huge staking rewards as a bonus i bought as much as i could as quickly as i could each time transferring to my NNO desktop wallet right after my last purchase cm went down so i have some on there still too im still hopeful it will come back online but in the meantime my personal eca wallet has already staked rewards and is working flawlessly keep your heads up and at the bare minimum learn the lesson of keeping your own wallets and hodl

	


isle of groestl
january pm
mtgox happened before there were a other coin to choose from 

electra has already shot its wad
with the NNO exchange up it cant even get past cents
with cm it reached cent
the momentum is gone
all you can do is hope for cm to come back
the eca community has been reduced to a bunch of whinig idiots
electra devs better get off their fucking ass and get in touch with cm dev and apologize for the death threats from its community 
slugs like ultor and sirstagg at eca discord allowed that shit to happen 


plof
january pm
coinmarket will be back online and it will come soon
just have a little faith and then eca will go to the moon 


wojteks


january am
i think the better faith we can have that eca on cryptopia is going to a rush run again not in cm exchange



johndoe
january am
coinmarket was fine for a while i guess the whole eca bullrun got people really crazy and crashed their server


roybatty
january am
actually i stored eca in my personal wallet and still holding it part of eca i nought just before cm was down may be lost what i want to know is tha if cm is not comming back how the total suppy and price would be changed

foxy
january am
i just hope what you are saying turn out to be true because if not i am going to suffer a significant setback


justoneanddone
january am
i guess you dont like to do any kind of research we made it to cents right before the entire market started to do down a simply search on cmc can prove that yes we reached but for a few brief seconds right before cm went down the devs and team members have done everything they can to get in touch with cm we even offered help but got no response from them we have absolutely no contact with cm now also you mention this as if the devs do nothing all day each dev is working on something at the moment and are very busy theres a reason why they arent on discord just chatting theres no need to start blaming people eca community is still very strong if you chose to leave fine by me youre calling the community whining idiots when youre the only one complaining


quier
january am
if coinmarket comes back everyone will withdraw their coin and transfer it to NNO exchange s it will be the end of them


ilitirit


anuary am
so if i understand correctly the cm debacle is electras fault

so other people who also cant access loads of other crypto on cm should be blaming eca

someone should get cnn on this right now



phashk
january am
cm will never come back they just fail to do their job at this level


isle of groestl
january am
you can bullshit yourself and others all you want as you remain in denial 
the fact is eca is doing nothing now without cm

wow look at eca takeoff currently says no one


justoneanddone



january am
the devs are working hard behind the scene and how am i in denial look at the market right now of all coin are in red why because the entire market is down like i said before if you want to leave then leave i dont understand why people like you just come back waste your time just to hate on a coin you seem to be such an expert why arent you trading other coin and because a billionaire then


isle of groestl
january pm
who says im hating on eca thats your extrapolation i am saying eca wont do jackshit without cm

im not asking your sorryass for approval if i want to leave or not 
eca was not doing jackshit before btc and other coin started tanking it started its decline once cm went down and continued after other pathetic exchange listed eca
why tons of eca are held hostage on cm 

how the fuck do you know what im invested in
you have to force your assumptions really just vacuous exptrapolations because you dont have the balls to ask 
youre not such hotshit here on bitcointalk are you no one to stroke you like at discord 


nicjobi
january pm
you dont have to defend yourself because of having an unpopular opinion i firmly agree that everything hangs on whether coinmarket comes back


isle of groestl

im neither defensive or offensive
every battle is won before its fought sun tzu

cm will be back
no worries


wojteks

ppl just losing their faith because of the time spent waiting for the something NNO from cm devs
but thats normal if cm and devs wanted to run out with your cryptocurrency than they wouldnt lose time for the work and statements

iammist

hi there

sorry if this question has been asked before but how long before we see rewards from staking ive had k eca in my wallet for day now and no rewards if it is a product of so many coin being locked up in cm thats fine ill just wait

cheers

conex
january pm
any cm update



justoneanddone
january pm
if you look at cm eca held a healtht value but as soon as we saw this entire market dip eca also dipped along with every other coin currently i believe that of the circulating supply is on cm this is the most that could be on cm maybe its less they did allow withdraws during the first week all we can do is wait

force assumptions what are you even talking about no one is stroking me on discord you like to call people out for wanting power you once told me that i get off on power and called me a faggot have you seen you facebook group its a close group where no one can post anything until you give them approval and if they dont agree with you you kick them without hesitation hows that for wanting power then you judge us for controlling our discord channel and attack a lot of my mods i think you have a serious issue and you should check up on it im not here for power or to silence people im simply to stop people from spreading false information


goodhabit
january pm
sorry but with the actual network weight and almost billion coin likely staking k is far to little to expect reward in any reasonable time you might have a look at the guess that is shown when you pull your mouse over the green arrow while the time decreases fast in the first few day and can go up sometimes if more people take their wallets online it will probably take longer than indicated with a relative small amount when you have been staking for more than day there is a possibilty that without changing the rules k on their own will never hit a block before max supply is reached


iammist
january am

thanks for the response what would you think would be the minimum stake i was lead to believe that this would be enough but obviously not

	



foxy
anuary am
i think you will have to hold atleast m token if you want to get stakes daily otherwise start with k but it will take some time for you get stakes




madmac


january am
all eca stuck in coinmarket and a bunch of kiddies crying for authorities to step in what should these authorities do other than potentially confiscate all business assets including all coin weve seen it with mtgox nobody has seen any coin back in years hope they can get their servers up running again but hosting is probably not the right solution for this they need real servers in a real datacenter


selectnumber
january am
the NNO site is very gorgeous but the website opens and the subsequences open more slowly which is a big team doing one thing

goodhabit
january am
my guess is that to stake at all your wallet needs a weight of ca million coin day to come close as long as the network weight is billion with k coin this would likely take ca day or roughly years one million in one block should stake every months if the million is split in to smaller amounts you might stake more frequent as the weight doesnt drop much after each stake but those will be small rewards only and on average be slower so you would loose out on compound interest
you could probably have near to daily stakes with one million only if you cut it in many small inputs of around k each but the initial wait would probably near months and the daily rewards would be very small for k my guess would be months until you reach first reward

almost daily staking that doesnt slow reward down for everyone would require at least inputs of at least million each so a total wallet size of mio

	


wojteks

not all eca and not only eca please remember about these people who wanted to invest their btc or ltc into eca on coinmarket

levontres
january pm
coin i love it transaction speed is simply amazing i look forward to the development of this coin


goodhabit
january pm
yes i know if everyone cuts his wallet in to several inputs everyone will stake slower i just answered this in a way correct for those who are more interested in staking frequently and not so much in getting maximum reward and if your total wallet size is to small faster might still mean never before max supply is reached

hodl january pm
many reasons
 coinmarket not quite back online yet see electraNNOs and facebook updates about cm coming back online soon
 micro exchange that eca is currently on dont provide for much volume
 eca massive staking reward means many people who invested are holding fast with no intention to sell
add the fact that larger exchange are scheduled to start trading eca soon the great development and communication from the devs the community around eca and the current price compared to other projects make for a fantastic hold investment

wow coinmarket not even online now i guess it looks even more like everyones money is gone activity on the site exploded when eca hit i second that idea a couple of comments up that suggested eca get involved somehow due to how much eca was on coinmarket


fsciety
january am
the eca team has been very responsive in regards to coinmarket and theres not much they can do but give coinmarket time and wait


zeroonezero
january am
i dont trust them either


hi everybody
i found something very interesting
can you guys share what you think about 

 looks like a coinmarketcom and electraprojectorg its one owner or one teamfor me its very wierd
why because they are group of scamers who try to play with your money manipulate even steal it

 now i understand why other big marketsyobitnextexchange and others doesnt want take this coin because they feeling sometging not clear and wrong

 what make me think its a scamer market and scam coin
 they been registered the same day almost the same time coinmarketcom and electraprojectorg 

here we go httpselectraprojectorgcutestatcom
then here httpscoinmarketcomcutestatcom

 thats why they hiding they afraid to be clear they trying to be smart ass

 possible that coinhouse and cryptobridge own by them too

 mostly i understand what they doing now basicly collecting all your bitcionsmoney and playing on the marketand they waiting that day btc will jump to the moon
thats way they trying to find so many reasons to extend the timeafter may be they will come back or they will disappear

 another things most of the team from web site its a bult team as believers they dont know each other on the real they know each other as project just from chat they manipulating themand i feel sorry for them



there is a lot of to say but please share what you think about


dekingcrypto
january am
you making a very good point because at first they made it look like the NNO dev abandoned the project but now the person who started this thread is still active and i believe is working with them secondly their first website is been updated but i doubt if they own crypto bridge or coinhouse




foxy
january am
they were looking for NNO hosting company so maybe they found them and transferring data

i also saw some twitter posts stating that most of the wallets are online

httpstwittercomecagiraffestatus
httpstwittercomcryptoearningstatus


zeroonezero
january am

you got it could be a planned work that i tought they trying to play like a smart ass and they know what they are doing i was saying crypto bridge coinhouse possible they own or its in one teamscammers team
also possibility they own not just eca may be some other shit coin too
another things in telegram chat most of user are bot if you pay attention there most of the time chatting the same people or everybody quiet its wierd
 one more things in telegram chat room they deleting negative smart questions or blocking user who posting smart questions no explanation at all they dont have answers for smart questions


fsciety
january pm
i bought my coin along all my friends on coinhouseeu and no issues transferring to our desktop wallet


wojteks
january pm

yes the whole fix the problem by coinmarket dev team is taking too much time but for me the most positive sign is that they really trying to do their job fine and also they keep updating eca team about the present situation

	




suspiciously square
january pm

even the small exchange are making money today because of all the flood of NNO crypto investors it doesnt make sense for coinmarket to close when its earning money they will probably get the problem fixed soon

 reed my topic on the top and tell me what you think about it


goodhabit
january pm
changing the order of your points a bit for clarity
well this one is obvious bullshit date looks similar but coinmarketcom was registered on march th and electraprojectorg was registered on september th so each time a nine and a tree in month and date but just half a year apart coinmarket was up and running long before the actual electrateam started to get formed and the webdomain registered and yes i look at the above links thats where i get the different dates from
quote
hahaha

nextexchange is not even up and running so to call it a big exchange seems a bit premature but electra is still on the list of the coin that will be listed from the start see nextexchange website

and then there is yobit yobit is up and running and you can find an non working electrabtc market since about weeks with buy orders problem is if you want to deposit yobit says since two weeks deposits for such currency are temporary offline so there cant be sell orders because no one can send electra to yobit

now this is a typical yobit problem you can find dozens of coin where devs and community are complaining because yobit doesnt answer their tickets doesnt include mandatory walletupdates remains on the wrong chain after a hardfork for years and yes you can also find many coin that dont even exist anymore because the chain died years ago no devs no community but still trade but of course no deposit and withdrawal on yobit they rarely ever care if a wallet of a non major coin is online or syncing properly so may be once they installed the electrawallet it took more than minutes to download the entire blockchain so yobit just gave up and kept the monney may be they will look in a few weeks if they now have an active wallet but hey that would be the usual level of support you get from yobit yobit doesnt care about quality so to claim that the fact that eca are still not actively traded on yobit because of quality is just ridiculous

i personally would never have suggested to apply to yobit
unlikely with coinhouse they just showed up a few day before coinmarket went belly up and benefited from it but they didnt list a large number of coin that got orphaned by coinmarket or novaexchange for that matter and quite a few coin with very low volume that you could get at bittrex et all and therefore not generating a big demand on a minor NNO exchange

definitely not with cryptobridge cryptobridge is a decentralized exchange with a own blockchain trading coin as token on their chain unfortunately i must admit as much as i like electra creating a decentralized exchange seems way over the head of the existing devteam especially months ago

NNOs on novaexchange

honoured customers and cryptocurrency enthusiasts you have been told a while ago now that we were planning to close down nova exchange in the beginning of we made this tough decision because nova exchange was growing at a speed and in a way that us the founders could not keep up with and run the business in a meaningful and secure way not wanting to make promises we might not be able to keep we didnt tell anyone not anyone that we never stopped looking for a way to keep going and keep nova exchange in business so we are so happy to announce that we have found a partner a NNO main shareholder willing and more importantly able to carry on running nova exchange the NNO owners we have made sure have the resources and the experience years in the business it takes to provide excellent service to you all we started negotiations and talks early in november last year and now we can tell you the good NNOs the show will go on more information will follow in the meantime just go keep on trading crypto best wishes to you all

coinmarket is working just for chat apparently here httpindexphpand everybody is asking when it will be online and apparently a dev said early today that they will give back all the coin to all the user in months minimun but is not confirmed that is a real dev the person who write that in the chat so apparently until now everything in that exchange is loss


goodhabit
january pm
is that all you have to say

but no not really i have been following electra since early june there have evidently been a lot of initial problems and i have asked some technical questions on that thread since early july you can find all of it here if you just read this annthread from the beginning there was very little activity during late july and august and most of september so it looked as might this coin as well die there were always some people staking but not much else and the NNO dev didnt comment all that much so doubt that he is still active arose then in late september a telegramm group was started not my prefered form of communication some people started to get involved but still it didnt seem to really get anywhere

there was always the exchange issue trading on nova far below one satoshi but always some very few trades at just on sat huge sellwall distorting the price leading to extreme fluctuations in the statistics of coinmarketcap very little trade on coinmarketcom only against doge clearly the secondary exchange then when nova was shutting more and more down the issue became more pressing but the only change was that coinmarket actually added btceca traiding with price differentiation as low as sat this was a more realistic price and thus on cm fluctuations werent that wilde as before but still early in december i was convinced that electra wont get anywhere

the fast rise in price starting from december th and getting more and more traction came as a huge surprise to me but most of the volume and price rise was just generated from december th to january and from january problems with coinmarket started although price still kept exploding

while i personally jumped back on the bandwagon on december th and saw my portfolio explode in value within just a few day i still have quite a few coin stuck on cm no net loss as the price explosion has multiplied my holdings and i pulled much more out than i had invested but still

so i hope but dont really believe that they might come back

but claims that the NNOly formed eca team has anything to do with the failure of cm seem really far fetched if eca wants to get far there are still huge challenges ahead and i have not seen a clear indication that the NNO team is up to it but for that we might at least wait out the whitepaper


futureballer
january am
eca total suppy is in the billions they can fork the lost coin stuck with cm and replace our coin then to keep the price stablized they can burn coin they used to replace our lost coin it would mean that the total supply is greatly decrease and less for the developers this is all my opinion of course also i want to tell all the fucktards who are on their high horse why the hell we didnt download to a wallet fuck you guys who would pose such a question theres a host of reason like maybe we wanted to just hold for a day and flip it or some of those who got coin are at a different leaning curve and the more experience buyers these people are going through pain and fuck eca for picking cm as their first choice to host this coin

rz

that exchange is never coming back because i might be wrong but i dont think website host migration takes so much time

if youre browsing and following this thread looking to feed your uncertainty the u in fud theres always half empty glass posters to fill that just know that there are a vast majority of others who are quietly holding fast staking in their personal wallets and believing in their investment and potential of electra not even thinking of selling research block explorer electra had previously announced NNO exchange coming online have and are very active in social media venues clear road map growing team research eca website and upcoming white paper cm not returning would in no way kill the eca future believe what you want just letting you know the positive side of the fud thats rampant lately due to cm if when cm comes back online and you want to dump your coin you had left there go ahead just remember that someone else is buying them

electras whitepaper has been released httpselectraprojectorgelectrawhitepaperpdf

there are still people who think month later that coinmarket will be backits funny

does anyone has issues with btc withdrawal from coinhouseeu
in short i tried to withdraw all of my btc using their withdraw all button as a result i have a record in my withdraw history with amount similar to ie decimals and status suspect
i cannot cancel this operation or use these coin to trade these shitheads do not answer freshdesk ticket or direct email day passed so far and i dont know if i will receive my coin
although my previous withdraws went just fine i wanted to warn people to avoid using this exchange at least do not use their withdraw all option and type the amount manually if this is the case

february pm
mostly every coin will be send instant you will get a personal transaction but bitcoin is different since january coinhouse has added batched bitcoin transaction these transaction need to be filled with multiple withdrawals depending on the amount of withdrawal requests that will calculate how often transaction will be done currently this is a few times a day but this will ge more often after more withdrawal requests

why did conhouse introduce this feature
batched transaction will cut transaction confirmation time and also fees will be cut also this is more efficient for the bitcoin network because we do more withdrawspayments in just one transaction this will cut the amount of bytes and also the amount of fees which are needed to get accepted into a NNO block on the network


starlngfebruary pm
oh come on its a bullshit a copypaste from their website bitcoin transaction fees were significantly reduced recently and they cannot compile a batch for day they could at least reply to my ticket or email
and yeah their withdrawal fee could cover a dozen of nearinstant transaction

 million eca were on cm many of which were electra devs so they say

if electra devs think they can just whitewash this issue forget it ive not even started electra devs wont be able to wash their hands of this issue dont try to bullshit us with talk of community while the NNO investors in the community get fuckedover

electra reddit whore pbpntballer had to lock this topic he got uncomfortable after i posted this comment 
youre the typical egotistical selfishbastard that will be exposed for not living by the golden rule it is the fault of electra for not doing their due diligence on this exchange they wont be able to whitewash it no matter how many hounddogs they have working for them imagine the great karma that would ensue if they announced they would reimburse not likely knowing the corrupt mortals of this generation in heaven they would reimburse not in hell

the developers behind electra have nothing to do with coinmarket full stop theyre not associated with them in any capacity except that electra was being traded on coinmarket

its an exchange issue not a dev issue

when you keep coin on a ghetto exchange you take the risk of having them stolen the devs didnt force you to keep your coin on cm

everything is not fine the community of eca is cheating to get on the exchange i hold more the m coin which i bought between sat so i actually invested a fair share

made this post again on reddit yes devs deleted my first post
eca community is scammingcheating to get on exchange made a whole post about this but devs deleted it
things that are happening in short ecas discord got a tipbot people are abusing the system and casting s of votes to get listed on exchange they got whole guides setup in discord devsmoderatorswhat ever you call them seem to dont care
they are spamming in discord to vote they setup a guide on how to vote endlessly thats how eca got listed on the last few exchange and thats how they are on top on every voting system people get showered with coin if votes increases alot
dont get me wrong i hold more then m coin which i bought between and sat but this is going to kill eca if this keeps up if exchange get wind of this its over
again dont get me wrong i bought my share but this aint beneficial for the coin

i was very positve about this project but this is making me lose my trust

i just shake my tired head at these type of posts same with the facebook page where you just about cant read through a single post without one of the same or people repeating and injecting their negative mantra electra is in crypto infant stage missed out not when doge is st in market cap and verge is th and crypto as a whole is just starting to get rolling
as far as the NNO exchange and voting ive never been on eca discord i saw a facebook post regarding voting went to the various sites and voted
as far as complaining about voting for too many exchange go to coinmarketcap and look at the other more established coin omg is on different exchange with volumes from to over million per exchange
i wish certain people would just get some wider perspective and think longer term regarding their investments ie dont flip out when after month you dont have a lambo

you cant get real proof so it remains guesswork based on hints but if we count the adresses in the top that were mostly created during the pump late december up to jan got most of their coin from earlier large addresses whales trying to profit from the price explosion by selling high slowly have no outpayment after jan th didnt stake between jan and jan th and stake very regularly ever since we get close to billion and yes my thesis is that cm wallet is mostly online and staking since jan th

ebruary pm
has anyone calculated an eta on electra reaching max supply of 

obviously an annual staking return of per year is extremely attractive but wont mean anything if we suddenly find out that the max supply will be reached within weeks


goodhabit
february pm
well if staking continues at present rate depending on how many coin are actually staked max supply should probably be reached around august its imo a bit disturbing that the whitepaper roadmap doesnt say anything about how to replace it as incentive to keep node online and if the staking rules would be changed before max supply is reached lets say to a declining ratio or a fixed reward per block time would already be very pressing if max supply should not be expanded


goodhabit
february pm
im not kidding but i think as well that dollars are very unlikely and thus i was suggesting that the steepest rise in eca is already behind us and thus if you bought for sat or more you likely bought shortly before or after the long time peak

dont know what happening but since january eca is falling each week by couple of satoshihope this will change in these couple of months but there are a lot of people with millions who are staking and as soon as they get something they dump it on exchange and the price goes more down
losing patience but ill still hold and i still believe in community

it is necessary to understand that if the currency does not support atomic swaps then it can not be quickly exchanged for currency with atomic swaps that is there will be a quick exchange between each other only by using nuclear swaps which in turn will require the introduction of a lightning net and this means that the competition will increase and the electret will no longer stand out here the role of currency marketing has to play its role the team will succeed the capitalization of electors will grow

lol i dont come here very often but i kNNO who posted this before i finished reading hahaha youre like the guy who wants to remain relevant so he screams fire the loudest ecas true base doesnt care about the current price were enjoying our investment returns with our wallet stakes and have no plan for selling

oh and i guess by your standards eca is now so that counts as mooning
as far as some think youre technically correct as in you and the other couple of people that fud here i guess can count as some



foxy
february am
probably never probably soon you never know because well its crypto and its hard to predict movements here


goodhabit
february am

well atomic swaps are basically the reinvention of barther just between blockchains the problem with barther is that you usually dont know anyone that wants to swapexchange with you at a fair rate thus markets and monney as means of exchange and unit of account had to be invented in the first place so this is a step backwards to the early digital stone age the examples with merchants are all totally wrong the merchant doesnt want to swap currency he wants to receive coin in exchange for goods or services and thus you will need a third party that is ready to swap the coin you have with the coin the merchant acceptst and the most efficient third party service liquidity will always be the largest centralized exchange not the safest or cheapest the most efficient

february am
to get eca every couple of weeks you must be holding around m or more token correct just trying to figure how many coin will i need to get stakes daily


zeusfebruary pm
in my wallet more than millions eca but i get reward only after day fom last reward its sad


goodhabit
february pm
well the staking process of electra clearly favors large and very large wallets at the present high network weight you might need more than mio eca to get at least one block a day if your wallet is broken in to several medium sized blocks mio might be sufficient im actually staking only about mio and get a block ca every dayalthough my wallet always says day but it can easily stay that way for a week with only millions you would be a candidate for every th block or with ca blocks a day every th day k are likely to take even much longer to months seem a realistic estimate but of course that way you risk to never get a block before max supply is actually reached

and yes unlike the stated goal on the website and still in the whitepaper electra has only had about and not blocks a day since the last hardfork on july th and therefore with less blocks generated fewer wallets get reward and the autosplitting of inputs that get reward within the first day further increases the network weight and this makes it more difficult for smaller wallets to get reward frequently and yes i first addressed this issue in this forum in late july and a few times in the following months but the devs dont see this as a problem that deserves correction

whats sad is electra is a pump and dump coin

httpscoinmarketcapcomcurrencyelectra

the chart tells the whole story

you should have sold when it was worth something


goodhabit
february pm

not really there was one huge pump in late december til january th but the dump couldnt follow because most of those wanting to dump at high price have their coin stuck on coinmarket
well what the chart shows is there hasnt been a real dump recently volume is far to low its slowly declining because demand is low but dump would be something else
its still worth something depends of course when you bought for all those who bought far below sat like sat or even below for dogeltc the actual price is still attractive so those can afford to wait if there will be another pump

read it and weep 

 massive eca pump the day before cm closed vol increasing over week
 coinhouse and coincontrol open the same day when cm close same owner as cm
 eca discord warns user not to withdrawal on ch and cc aka you cant withdrawal only buy
 no one can withdrawal more than btc from ch or cc they will send to the wrong address etc
 eca added to cryptobridge fatbtc no volume basically no one buys eca
 cm has over billion eca basically of eca if it were to open eca would be worthless

conclusion classic pump and dump exchangecoin
lesson never buy a coin that is only traded from one source


johndoe

cries the keyboard warrior who lost million maybe you should buy more of them so you can stake them better

it gets cold so you should make a fire

lesson dont keep your eca in online exchange but cryptobridge has lots of volume

who knows

this isnt a house of cards that could go up in flames

this is a house of rocks and ridges








goodhabit


february pm

you are extremely exaggerating

correct massive pump almost no volume at all at the start of december price below sat or below so the actual price increase is more like times or within about more than weeks but the increase also happend to other coin on cm and the volume of cm increased from a few k day to more than mio day so that they would crash seems plausible cm was always a very marginal exchange before december and looked pretty unprofessional so that they couldnt handle such an increase seems plausible but there reaction isnt agree that it more or less looks clearly as an exit scam now although they are still staking most of the coin

coinhouse opened a few day earlier but was absolutely unknown ofc we dont know anything about the owners of cm ch or coincontrol to claim that they are the same seems a bit far fetched at least they dont use a similar webinterface and have two factor autentification and besides eca they only listed very few if at all coin that were also strong on cm

dont know what your talking about withdrawal both from coinhouse and coincontrols usually works it seems that there is an issue with fatbtc as they require a relative high minimum withdrawal and rather high withdrawal fees my withdrawals from coinhouse and coincontrol all went to the correct address

 wrong i did withdraw ca btc from coinhouse in transaction over day the only problem was that the later transaction were first declared suspect and needed a support ticket to get cleared dont know if they improved it in the meantime was in early january withdrawal from cc no problems although no large amounts

 the volume on cryptobridge and fatbtc is rather modest although much higher than on all exchange combined before the mid of december so not that many people want to buy thus the price is declining but there is also no real dump for a decent pump you would actually need a larger exchange that would attract potential buyers

 according to my analysis cm has ca bio eca and is regularly staking where you get the billion figure from idk this is definitely wrong i could easily point to accounts holding bio eca that are definitely not at cm and of course the eca telegramm or discord group would give you much lower numbers but the fact that the admins there spread confidence in cm returning as dogma should turn people away

classic pump and dump coin hm are there many others probably of the people that recently joined the crypto market just did so because they hope to get rich quick they dont do any research and thus most coin rise due to pumps only easier on one large exchange eg bittrex and not due to change in fundamentals and some crash after pumps but most people are just blinded by whitepapers that promise a big future but will mostly never deliver or not meet any demand in the global marketor jump in at high price because of fomo so pumping is the only way to make monney in crypto or daytraiding everyone is mostly looking for bagholders i dont really claim that electra is better but this is something you could say about at least a thousand other coin and especially most ethtoken

well the wallet is online and it shows eca but under the total of monney supply that is the total monney supply as shown on the explorer and not the coin on coinmarket
well i would like to know where you see the mil on the explorer which addresses do you see as cm adresses and of course your right that the bil is the total supply

i did a longer analysis with the explorer and did identify many addresses that i think are most likely on cm the not complete list follow

efadtcwqaknxjpndfvtzzdayycdejl

the total of eca on those addresses amounts to almost billion i did a systematic check for all the top addresses on the richlist and also added some smaller addresses that were created as change addresses trough payouts and otherwise meet the pattern

what all of those addresses have in common is that they were created late in december or the first day of january have received most coin from older big addresses and usually the bulk from one address only often had some outpayments before january th
none of those accounts have any transaction between after january th and before january but all of those accounts are staking very regularly ever since and none have other transaction beside stakes after january th

for the smaller accounts this might not be significant in itself but accounts with more than mio coin usually stake daily if they are online so while some of those addresses might actually not be on cm i did no systematically check for ranks of the richlist
and there will be many smaller accounts mostly change addresses that are on cm as well

the fact that all this addresses are regularly staking and that the cm website on its old or non https addresses shows wallets regularly online doesnt say anything on itself about the likelyhood of cm coming back ever
the official web address httpscoinmarketcom is not reachable via cloudflare since day

so may be the fact that we can only see the old servers that show no change at all besides the amounts of coin on the online wallets beeing updated and the occasional change in the headertext could also be an indication that the old host just keeps the servers running
but that nobody of the cm team is ever accessing them they might have disolved the boss might have run without most of the coin the owner might already be in jail or sufferd a stroke or heart attack and is now in hospital or dead we just no nothing but the only signs of activity like additional lines in the header from bear with us to few hours to last db issues might as well be the work of a simple hacker

we know nothing for certain but if anyone from the team had access and wanted to save his business he would have tried to communicate better so while we dont know what really happend we can be pretty sure that no competent person is in charge


while there is no clear indication of cooperation between the ecateam and coinmarket the attitude of the ecateam towards critics is at least disturbing they are usually claiming that they are certain that cm will come back and strike down so called fuders if they could be certain they would need to have a connection what they deny

but insisting on totally unfounded spreading of confidence delusions is not helping at all creating confidence without base in facts is actually the usual modus operandi of scammers and it should be considered a serious crime

these adresses doesnt belnog to coinmarket you cant know what wallet adress coinmarket had two months ago these claims just bullshits

and here we see noone critices eca they always find ways to defend themselves this coin was dead after coinmarket down

well if you can use the explorer properly you can analyze movements on addresses with timestamp and thus identify patterns that would give a very high probability there might be some false positives but not that many on the larger addresses and the owners of such addresses could just prove me wrong by shifting some coin now but if you are to dumb to learn how to use the explorer you can cry whatever you want and the statement doesnt belong sounds knowledgeable so i might as well here your reasoning
wrong again eca seemed pretty dead most of the time between june to mid december and until mid december coinmarket was a very marginal exchange so with the pump of eca not starting before dec th and culminating between dec th and jan th became relatively important for just a few day then it crashed while eca is now down to of its peak price its still times higher than it was on average before the pump that means for most of its existence so while not all is well its pretty much more alive than ever before the mid of december

websites crash all the time some come online after a short time or at least have frequent updates like electraprojectorg others dont like coinmarketcom at least til now and imo most likely ever




johndoe

just wanted to reiterate one fact that an admin of another coin did indeed visit coinmarketcom address since a bunch of their coin were stolen too

first off
we completely understand the communitys frustrations regarding coinmarket but do not wish to start a manhunt on the owners to harass or threaten them this is not the type of impression lemanum wishes to convey recently i tinydavetinyguy personally traded under euros worth of lemanum to check if everything was working as it should be it was not the coinmarket situation has adversely effected the lemanum community due to witholding over million lemanum coin this is unacceptable

the address information
bitcointalk user stoffel created an impressive writeup which contained all of the contact details they were able to find regarding the location of coinmarket this can be found here httpsbitcointalkorgindexphptopicmsgmsg the address details obtained are as follows surinamestraat den haag which is in the netherlands as stoffel stated there is a foundation as well as a business registered to this address this can be confirmed by visiting the website of the kvk dutch chamber of commerce httpswwwkvknlzoekenhandelsregisteruitgebreidzoekenhandelsnaamkvknummerstraatsurinamestraatpostcodehuisnummerplaatsden haaghoofdvestigingtruerechtspersoontruenevenvestigingtruezoekvervallenzoekuitgeschrevenstartinitialsearchfielduitgebreidzoeken

a visit from another user
another bitcointalk user under the name fred visited the above mentioned address according to fred an elderly man opened the door and insisted he was not affiliated with cm httpsbitcointalkorgindexphptopicmsgmsg naturally this raised further questions

my first visit
on th january around h i arrived at the surinamestraat lamborghinis aston martins bmws as well as a number of other equally flashy and expensive cars were parked on this street the majority of the houses must have been worth in excess of btc the ambassador of panama also appears to be living here httpswwwgooglenlmapsayhtdatamemswgdgfoofngwgmnmbvwhaeii

having taken in the sites i then arrived at the property where cm are supposedly located to say that the mansion was huge is something of an understatement the ground floor houses a private gallery for paintings the second and third floors house swanky living areas for the propertys residents i rang the doorbell multiple times to no answer i then wrote a short letter asking to be contacted and posted this through the letter box i am yet to receive a response

my second visit
on the following day th january around h i visited the surinamestraat again after ringing the doorbell multiple times an elderly man screamed through the letter box

elderly man who is there
me dave lastname from city im here because a company registered a website to this address
the website is down and has taken a lot of peoples money with it since it appears that the owners of the website are unwilling to communicate i decided to check the address for myself
elderly man what are your contact details
me phone number and email
elderly man what is your fax number
me fax i dont have one
elderly man mmm ok so what is the name of the website
me coinmarketcom
elderly man let me write that down can you please read it out
me c o i n s m a r k e t s c o m
elderly man what did they do
me this iswas a marketplace where you can trade bitcoin for altcoin the website went down on the fifth of january
elderly man say what bitcoin and altcoin i dont know anything about bitcoin
me if i may ask there are two businesses registered to this address name company and name foundation do any of these belong to you
elderly man yes both of these are my companies the foundation was founded by myself years ago and bares no relation to the trading of bitcoin
me are you willing to press charges against coinmarket for fraud
elderly man if it can be proven that my address is falsely being used then yes
me you can find this on the website whoiscom
elderly man another young man also came here a week ago and said he had lost money did you lose any money too
me personally i have lost nothing people who i know however are extremely concerned that they have lost a lot of money millions of euro are currently being witheld
elderly man how much
me more than one million euro
elderly man i will read up on the internet about this site if my address is being used rest assured that i will be pressing charges i will call you before the weekend with an update

the below picture confirms that i was at said property further updates on coinmarket will be provided in due course

when will eca devs be having a public meeting
you know like other coin go out and promote themselves

well only isnt the correct term until late in december network weight was mostly below billion so the increase just means that it takes more and more time to get your expected reward because to many small inputs are staking slowing reward down for everyone

february am
looks like the chinese troll farms are already put into play sounds more like a personal vendetta against the owners of electra your only posts have been regarding fud against electra exposing the identity of electra doesnt prove anything you hide behind a fake name i assume youre busy creating some screenshots to support your claims while you protect your inside source

so electra devs conceived an elaborate and expensive scheme to steal eca by getting them locked in cm knowing the price would drift downward during the delays and are trickle selling them on a couple other small exchange even though they could have bought almost all of them when they began working on the project and sold them during the massive gain and to further confuse the investors they continued to remain active on social media continued to develop and meet the road map continued to add to the development team adding to the website getting github discord telegram and such running whitepaper publishing and updating etc etc etc my god you guys are a NNO kind of fud even isle of idiots has upped his estimate of eca on cm to billion lol

no one ever told me to stake on cm that would be stupid to fork over a big percentage to cm when i could have the full amount in my own wallet which has worked flawlessly i found eca during last years big explosion downloaded the wallet never had any delay in sending even up to figures at one time of eca from cm

putting your finger on your cheek while you ponder conspiracys doesnt make you a deep thinking philosopher youre trolls burnt by your irresponsibility

dear all

today there was a business dinner with a company which has b year the aim of this contact was to use eca for their online stores and as payment option the dinner was fruitfull and both sides were satisfied

the company which is well known globallyalmost everyone knows this company will have some internal meetings in the next weeks meanwhile we hope to have some more meetings once agreed they make an announcement through their official NNOs channels we will also disclose the name of the company as well

please understand as due to some nda conditions we cant disclose more info we hope to get your understanding at this point

but some people will just keep on with the fud and conspiracy theories well after the rest of cm is fully back online its just how it is once in a while just reply with facts in hope that NNO readers will get a better fuller perspective

side fact i had left some eca to trade with on cm while the bulk of my holdings were safely staking in my desk wallet and after months of repeated cm stole your coin exit scam eca devs created cm to steal your coin blah blah blah today i logged in and transferred my balance to my wallet

sure as expected but look at the transaction sizes people taking losses on sales of or less the largest figures are the buying one person dropped the price by selling just k eca feel bad for the peeps who dumped there small holdings at a loss just to see it double hours later itll all even out after it goes up and down a bunch then the coin can move on awesome growth ahead in my opinion

it will vary it is based upon your wallet weight which is determined by the amount of coin you have and how long they are stationary in your wallet
once the coin mature over hours in your wallet your wallet weight will begin to grow your wallet doesnt have to be online the day and weight will track and build but having it on helps the network ive turned my computer off and still had my stakes calculate and arrive i leave it on a lot because i want to help the network ive had stakes in as little as day and up to but i have a lot of eca the most important part is holding because your weight will grow each day and youll get your rewards

ot yet proposed community coin looking for input the approach addresses many major growth issues ahead forward thinking in my opinion so many top market cap coin punting the hard issues down the road and relying on speculation and hype for and cred this eca update is looking into scaling growth inflation community involvement day trading volume and on and on i hold a ton of eca and applaud the hard choices for long term success and a solid foundation for instead of smoke and mirrors and hype

eca will fall below sat its current price is due to whales that got in for quick profits last year and caused the crash of coinmarket fundamental basis eca should be trading below sat theres a flood coming from regulators soon and only very high market capital coin will survive and others will go down the drain of mergers a coin like eca stood no chance of surviving not even when its listed in the top five exchange needless of saying is not even listed in one of the top exchange yet lately you hear the director of international monetary fund imf christine lagarde saying on weekly basis that crypto regulation is inevitable once they dropped the announcement it will be like a bomb to crypto world and a coin like eca will be useless overnight you cant even sell it for sat like it was before the whales hype no am not fuding but telling the NNObies the fact cos the legendary traders knows the fact and thats why they are most active in the top coin right now good luck

you want to manipulate the price
you do not argue any argument you speak in general
you are not at all familiar with what happened in the cryptovalut market at the end of and early 
people like crazy entered the crypto and bought it all in a row
all coin went up to times
eca was not prepared for such a sudden increase it has just started investing marketing opening up NNO currency exchange offices
you mentioned coinmarket the eca ended up at the coinmarket exchange office just because the nova exchange closed its doors where the eca traded
i am a witness to all these firsthand events

you mentioned the mmf
this fall in prices has only happened because big players world powers enter the race and buy a cheaper cryptocurrency again
and once again crypto will experience its flourish will do the same at the peak will sell will drop the price and buy it again 
this is how it works all over the world world powers rulers of the world make money on ordinary people

i think the eca has a future
and they will survive those coin that will have practical application and the eca is one of them


sols march pm
i would like to make a post into this thread just as a post to point to in the future

after wrestling with some issues for the last couple months i decided to move on from eca i still hang out with the community though i wanted to help make a clear distinction i was not associated with electra i believed in eca and our collective vision up until recently i have my reasons most are relatively subjective

if anything ever happens with eca look for someone else to blame im no longer part of it 

good luck everyone

uh no ecas volume shows that almost all of ecas billion available are being held calmly off the market until after the bear market turns which is when the devs will begin making big NNO announcements hope you didnt catch a falling knife with nexus as the big pump and dump was a week ago with over million in volume now dwindled down to million along with the price hope it turns around for ya even though you now trash eca cuz you sold i still dont want you to lose your money but no there is no way eca peeps are dumping for nexus just you

march pm	 

lets study something about human nature
when do we say bad words about something only out of disgust or frustration or when we dont get out of something what we expected

so no sane mind would believe that isle has actually earned profit and after earning profit he began saying bad word about electra there is no good reason for doing that atleast humans wont do it thats human nature

the only reason i could of think of is that he obviously bought eca when it was high he believed in eca coin but he is weak at heart so he sold his coin when eca began to come down and bought this nexus which was going ok when eca was coming down but he got late in catching that train too now nexus price is dipping with each day and eca is steady n rising back and this makes him even more angry and he is using more bad words here for eca and its members
he is a poor guy and playing catch up and getting more n more frustrated with each day please dont give him much importance he might be not in good mental health after all the loses after all its hard earned money

i hope he could come back to eca because he believed in this coin before investing in eca and should stick to it he will get back his lost money

best of luck

question to the community for our upcoming in depth review on eca ive tracked down of the appearently dev wallets the premine went to ejxiqybtyjvdnerltfdzmcgzcvz can anyone tell me the other wallets trying to get a judge of remaining eca to fund development marketing etc

good to see how few things for this coin is coming along i have been staking this coin for couple of months now and must admit that it has been a smooth journey so far i have had no issues at all and have been staking with any hiccups i would say that if everyone holds their coin and less coin are available in the market this will affect the price in a positive manner and we all can benefit from it would also love to see some NNO improvement plans and roadmaps to take this to next level do we still have an active dev around this project as i didnt saw electra in a while

i have a ssd as my c drive so always attempt to install wallets to d
the electra install program allows me to do this

i then move the cusercomputer name hereappdataroamingelectra folder into the install directory on d

then i create a shortcut in cusercomputer name hereappdataroamingelectra to point to that folder as follows

mklink j cusercomputer name hereappdataroamingelectra dfull walletselectracoinelectracoin walletelectra

however this results in a runtime error

other wallets work fine with the above methodology but not electra

does anyone know how to get the data directory cusercomputer name hereappdataroamingelectra off c and onto d 

could an option be included in the install program to specify where the data directory is located

in case its useful here is a quick summary of how these junction shortcuts work

open command prompt as an administrator to run these commands
they create the shortcut

j is the junction switch
cpath is the name and path of the shortcut to be created
dpath is where the target files and folders are located
note if spaces are used in the paths then that path must be enclosed in quotes

any help would be appreciated

it will vary it is based upon your wallet weight which is determined by the amount of coin you have and how long they are stationary in your wallet
once the coin mature over hours in your wallet your wallet weight will begin to grow your wallet doesnt have to be online the day and weight will track and build but having it on helps the network ive turned my computer off and still had my stakes calculate and arrive i leave it on a lot because i want to help the network ive had stakes in as little as day and up to but i have a lot of eca the most important part is holding because your weight will grow each day and youll get your rewards

circulating supply
 eca
total supply
 eca
max supply
 eca

with a pos of this means that there will be staked about this year so about a bill a month
 but the total supply is bill right
so in theory at best there is a max of months of stake and then the coin reaches its max so no more rewards
am i right or am i missing something
is any fork in the roadmap to make this coin stake again after it reaches his max supply to keep this coin live 
thanx

coinmaster
march pm
stake reward is being decreased to soon
while decreasing the block time n increasing the block size

after staking hits a max supply the only rewards generated is from transaction costs by then eca will be much more expensive per coin

thanks

goodhabit march pm
more or less if its more that could be the case that you sent some coin away to other address and that a changeaddress was created in your wallet this is the default mode if you dont set a default change address you can check this with the coincontrol feature of the wallet

electra april pm
today is electras one year anniversary over the course of the year electra has faced many obstacles and has overcome them successfully to become the premier nist cryptocurrency since the start of our existence we overcame a blockchain freeze the novaexchange takeover and coinmarket blocking all accounts our largest initial miners stakeholders and investors during the early stages of electra have become usd millionaires today electra is stronger than ever we have a large community and are listed on multiple exchange

the bonanza was a great success and drew in a lot of people which kickstarted electra with a large user base for a short moment right between when we fixed our frozen blockchain and the selloff that followed electra became the first cryptocurrency to surpass bitcoin circulating supplyprice market cap on june and no one can take this away from us since then some of our june data has been omitted or deleted

we are busy working on an update for the electra blockchain that will improve security and make electra eligible for atomic swaps via the komodo platform i am working with toplevel consultants in order to ensure that electras blockchain is updated with quality the community has been tasked with gathering data on node latency which will be used to decide whether to change the block time or not eta for this update is within two months and i dont plan to apply to NNO exchange during this time

since publishing electra i have been highly impressed with the level of cooperativeness within the cryptocurrency community electra broke through the competition because of the mutual support between its user and its openness to NNOcomers some members of the community plan to set up a nonprofit foundation for electra this year which i will fully support in the future i hope to see electra governed by the foundation set up by its own community i will continue to contribute to electra after the foundation is set up the cryptocurrency world has changed a lot over the past year competition and barriers to entry have increased greatly electra has adapted to this NNO environment and will continue to do so

i have my coin blocked in coinhouse exchange no withdraw option any sugestions


daniel april am
posted this in the eca reddit and it got hiddenmoderated so ill ask here


thoughts pleasedesktop wallet to cryptobridge took minutes

 minutes before any confirmations showing in the wallet then confirmations in minutes shown in the wallet to show on cryptobridge

comparison i can do xlm and xrp in less than minutes and litecoin minutes



further i dont see anything wrong with this question and the reddit has got serious issues with over moderating seriously off putting to say the least what happened to free speech

NNO rules of conduct maybe

dont post anything but glowing praise in the eca reddit


johndoe april pm
sending eca is nearinstant however the block times are the problem it is a minute block time right now that means each confirmation is minutes it took almost two hours to get onto cryptopia it is a known problem that will be fixed in the future with the second block times

i myself could not withdraw electra from the exchange koinmarkets but a month later the conclusion was opened my entire team withdrew the funds the conclusion was open for a month maybe even now i do not know
funny comments specially came the price to bring down what to buy cheaper good try

great NNOs with those three exchangei know they are still NNO and volume is low but time will be on our siderome was not built in one daywait and seesame happened with bitcoin since

i cant argue with you there i really appreciate that fact along with many others i love eca

how is going this project was following it closely but now we dont hear so much about it like months agoi appreciated the tech behind it



digital drug lord april am
well what really happened is eca created a website called coinmarket where they offered low fees then after people deposited alot of btc the site went down

then created coincontrol which only sold eca when it came out

they also created coinhouse and robbed people trading

it wasnt until they said they were getting lawyers that they released eca but by the time they released it eca was stats

so now coinmarket has like shit coin and they release like shit coin a week

they still havent gotten to the big coin like ltc btc eth

yes they countine the scam

they claimed it was the great demand for eca that crashed coinmarket well eca made it to cryptopia and look at it still stats

thats bad


elajean april am

eca can be listed on cryptaldash this could be huge we are th right now and need to be in the first on the list lets show them our big community and go now vote for eca httpswwwcryptaldashcomNNOcoinlisting share the link too to develop the project

evgen april am
nonsense

these are just words no facts
what kind ltc btc are you serious project electra is less than a year on the market

i take these events into account but i can not be indifferent when you say that this is a scam coin

i personally earned on this coin pos mining
electra has an excellent community i moder ru chat very warm and friendly team

and by the way there were no moments as with the verge for example no payments to uncles for advertising everything is always by the team by voting

lol what

coinmarket were operational before eca launched and gained volume
here is the proof
httpswebarchiveorgwebhttpcoinmarketcomNNOsphp
a web arhcives copy of coinmarket NNOs page that contains info about the launch date ok the first coin was added only but still it wasnt eca
besides that eca was added to coinmarket only last autumn this thread cointains a post from coinmarket dev about adding eca to their exchange
of course you could think theories about their collusion but man wheres your proof they enabled eca withrawals first so that the haters would hate a bit less but no

im just tired of this nonsense here and in coinmarket chatbox

offical NNOs httpstwittercomelectracoinecastatus

im just wondering the bottom of the NNO wallets github page contains a roadmap with lots of unchecked items like send and receive electra the base features are these features implemented and what about staking does the NNO wallet allow to stake




johndoeapril pm
i currently have my wallet staking on my pc do i need to upgrade to the NNO wallet or can i still use the old one

will the NNO wallet be mandatory once the fork happens in the near future

cryenthuapril pm
you can still use the old one for now until the fork occurs it is recommended though that you switch over to the NNO one

 electra is in first place in terms of trading volume on cryptopia

congrats to the electra coin on being the coin on cryptopia right now right now our volume has exceeded million for a satoshi coin simply amazing


drei april am
great NNOs about the NNO wallet where can i find out how to install it on mac os so as not to lose coin on the old one

ginzink april am

my mate have been in electra for some time and i got curious wow am i sad i did not know about it in april and mined that for just one day at the bonanza probably roi of the rig in just one day if held to this year haha

goodhabitapril am
read the manual on the download page carefully

goodhabitapril am
unless there would be an update for the qt wallet before the fork

actually i believe that exchange will require that because they couldnt use a wallet that only allows for a very limited number of addresses

compared to the qtwallet the functionality of the desktop wallet is much reduced good for NNObies that arent interested in the tech and the autoupdate is of course a step towards centralization

and i just noticed that none of the top addresses have transfered their coin yet so they are either waiting or leaving their coin on the legacy addresses or some are just missing the update and might end up on a different chain



melvoapril am
there is a specific date for the ico

evgenapril am
the electra will not have ico
my investment blog httpsevgenru


johndoeapril pm
electra did not have an ico this is a community coin everyone essentially volunteered their time and effort to make this a great coin

rsgaapril pm
my question is the following the NNO wallet will only have a bit version or also open a bit version since in my case i only have a bit windows and the update tells me that i have to have bit windows


kagamiapril pm
it will work on your operating system they will likely have two versions either way the answer is not to worry about it itll work

johndoe april pm
you have to use the bit qt wallet a bit program will not work on a bit go use the old version of the wallet

linkdefeu april pm
i dl the last wallet i like it he is verry nice and beautiful

the NNO wallet is necessary for future developments like electrapaythis year electra will hit top coin mc we have an amazing team of developers and community

mattcwuapril am
im confused coinmarketcom was confirmed dumping colx alqo shield and eca i saw the screenshots showing the deposit addresses and the blockchain movements the colx alqo and shield teams confirmed this why is master den one of ecas core team defending coinmarketcom and banning the topic for discussion on telegram 
what does eca have to gain by illogically defending coinmarketcom

hameshsmithapril am
this might be something to do with it auto splitting your coin instead of having to manually split your coin between multiple wallets not sure though 

citisiaapril pm

share this video i made about electra

electra undervalued gem

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkpmrnsqfeatureyoutube


narandzaapril pm
hello

 
i am a proud owner of some electra coin because i like your project
i downloaded the offical windows wallet and transfered my coin
after the installation and one day of waiting it started staking done the NNO config etc
my network weight was growing from day to day and the time to the reward was sinking


yesterday the wallet updatet it self and there was a phrase telling not to keep more then k coin in the purse so i moved them to my savings
after that i lookered for the wallet info and now my weight is again not staking


is all my progress killed by moving the coin from one address to the other are the wallet addresses connected to each other
do the coin have to be on a specific address purse savings or checking to stake
the status of my wallet now is encrypted and not staking another hours for the coin to mature 

thx a lot

electraapril am
on april a bug in the communitymade wallet caused losses to multiple user that amounted to about million eca this in us dollars is close to at today value the community developers have informed me that the bug has since been fixed note that this did not happen in the electra core wallet which has been working flawlessly for the past year

though i have nothing to do with the development of the communitymade wallet in order to protect the stability of the electra ecosystem and its ensure longterm growth i have decided to compensate all the affected user fully from the premine

i will not do a bailout like this again please be very cautious when downloading wallets other than the core wallet i ask the community developers to be more careful when releasing wallets in the future that being said the community wallet is highly innovative and i sincerely hope they will continue to develop it along with the other projects they have going such as electra social pay

the compensations will be sent today for reference i have included a spreadsheet showing all the affected addresses

 







hienvienlangapril pm
thanks for your noti 



bstewartapril pm
for mining sometimes it can take a few day or so in order for your token to mature i assume thats probably the issue youre having give it a few day and check back

johndoeapril am
interesting so do you recommend not using the community wallet stick with the qt wallet instead



kiddoapril am
this is always recommended to keep your coin in your desktop wallet or if is possible to a hardware wallet

electraapril am
if you are riskaverse use the core wallet the community wallet is still being developed and as its code is modified may sometimes run into problems

johndoeapril pm

alright thanks electra it is very interesting that the community wallet ran into these problems ill wait until they get more updates and bug fixes in before completing the switch

goodhabitapril pm

nothing particular about eca in this if you run a full synced wallets all coin will show incoming transaction asapthat is within a few seconds there isnt a reason why it should be slower than sending email sometimes you have to wait till exchange really execute the withdraw

but the point most people miss is that all coin only become spendable once they have sufficient confirmations on the blockchain usually if you send coin to an exchange they only show up on your balance as deposits pending after the first confirmation

quote
furthermore i hope that a mobile wallet will be developed because if thats the case i will become even more enthusiastic if mining is possible in the mobile wallet

this seems most unlikely staking on a mobile wallet would require that you have the entire blockchain downloaded on your device and are almost always online if you have unlimited data this might technically be possible but would certainly not the thing you should expect

any tips on getting the electra wallet to sync

ive got the latest windows version bit windows 

ive put the NNO electraconf file in place under cuserusernameappdataroamingelectra

there seems to be two electraconf files to download one from the website and one from a google docs link theyre different and ive tried them both

i get connection timeout repeatedly in the debuglog over and over ive let it run for several hours and it wont sync a single block

ive reinstalled ive rebooted

ive unblocked it from the windows firewall ive even tried forwarding port on my router still no luck

what am i missing

johndoemay pm
turn off your firewall completely connection timeout denotes that the wallet is trying to establish connections but cannot and after a time it will not continue

davemay pm
ive also tried turning the firewall off completely it makes no difference still blocks synced

evgen may pm
eca to the moon

daniel may am
very honourable to bail out those losses i must say

you say if you are riskaverse use the core wallet which i assume is the qt wallet

but community are putting it out there telling people to transfer to the NNO desktop wallet as soon as possible

which is it

and who authorised the release of the desktop wallet its almost like nobody tested it first which version had the bug because i used version v to get around a bug in v

and wow someone holds million eca worth k then loses it because of a wallet bug 

danielmay am
which wallet old qt or NNO desktop

starlng may am
i know the guy who got these m in person so he told me that these m look like mined eg looks noone has lost coin from their wallets but rather that guy just got everybodys stake reward right
correct me if im wrong

and yes i dont think he will lose these coin

the m went to a random person im not sure what youre saying

	



johndoe may am
no one lost million coin they are fine and worked themself out no need to spread misinformation



goodhabit may am
to those who didnt notice how it went at block someone tried to transfer this mio to a NNO address but only eca arrived all the rest was considered fee and thus went to the address that staked that block combined with the stake reward and the NNO input probably the others went a similar way but dont now the block number so in fact someone got a much to high stake reward

starlng may am
thanks for the explanation yes youre right it was a wallet issue but the guy who received this fee is not a cheater he was just staking his coin and was lucky enough to stake this block
yes this amount m is much greater than the usual stake reward it was even more than he had on this address but its not his fault right
should he return these coin i dont know
electra has done the right thing by compensating the loss from the premine but it should have been done by the guys who created this wallet

lekleklek may am
does electra have superblocks or does it just stake at a normal percentage how would some one stake such a high amount

goodhabit may am
well like with most coin the system that minesstakes a block usually gets the block reward eventuell transaction fees if there are other transaction and reward and fees are just added together as one output in this case the bug used almoust all of the sent amount as fee so almoust nothing arrived at the destination address and as usual the fees got combined with the reward

ecafriendly may pm
hello everyone

my apologies in advance for the long winded post but i feel it is important to be said i am one of the many investors that are now stuck in limbo with coinhouseeu unfortunately there were many complaints about this site on twitter and discord but i did not see them before depositing btc to buy roughly million more eca to add to my bag apparently there was an issue with coinhouse for weeks and the electra team took no action for over a month

when i asked several electra team members to contact coinhouse i felt brushed aside after they contacted coinhouse i asked for updates and was totally ignored by multiple members i also suggested they obtain exchange owners identities before promoting their exchange and i was told that cannot be done because eca is open source and anyone can list it well that may be true but there is a difference in just being listed on an exchange and promoting an exchange if you dont know the owners it would be wise to not promote the exchange

in this age of technology it is not hard at all to verify who someone is there are identity verification services several social media platform business registration documents etc

i am not saying all of this because i wish this community harm or harbor ill will i am someone who is heavily invested in eca bought at satoshs and never sold a single coin even as i watched it drop all the way down to satoshis i just think the electra team needs to do better and do more to protect its investors

i am by no means a whale but i have put roughly k into electra and have also been building a marketing platform that i was going to pretty much gift to eca and now i will be lucky if i ever recoup my investment so i will no longer invest in eca i am not important but eca will struggle to reach its potential without investors like me and you will continue losing them if you do not protect them

i wish you all the best and hope the electra team takes this to heart

daniel may pm
i am going to post my generic response to this issue

if you put more than at anyone time into any of these small time exchange with hidden whois your an idiot

i do agree that eca team should not promote any exchange unless its binance or coinbase or some other top exchange when they going to learn i dont know

ecafriendlymay pm
most coin start out on these types of exchange i made several small test buys before making larger purchases and always withdrew instantly without a problem i and others got screwed because an exchange that electra promoted and still does in the announcement post here stopped allowing eca withdrawals and even tho apparently the eca team was well aware of it they did not warn the community coinhouse apparently informed them weeks ago and nothing was said to the public

hodl may am
i have always considered any exchange a risk since i first started in crypto its the number one rule you dont control your cointoken unless you have them in your own wallet ive never assumed electra was endorsing any individual exchange but just notifying people where eca is currently available for trading when i found eca last year and went to coinmarket i was super suspect as it was a gong show exchange so when i made my large purchases i sent them to my wallet right away i accepted the risk when i left a little on there and got those coin back when eca stepped up the pressure on cm i did a lot of reading about the other exchange available such as coinhouse and read mostly horrible reviews from other coin projects it didnt take much research to find all the horrid experiences people had at coinhouse major red flags and low volume

i waited and instead did some trading for a lot more when cryptopia came online but still sent any eca straight back to my wallet to add to my staking sorry you are getting burned but if you leave on an exchange youre accepting the potential loss learn from it dont blame others like i said before its the number one crypto rule

ecafriendly may pm
the problem for me and several others was that i sent btc to ch to buy eca and i went to withdraw it immediately and couldnt i never keep my coin on exchange and i have been a eca hodler since i first bought it i am not blaming electra but they absolutely could have and should have done a better job at warning the community and that is why i made my post my losses as well as many others could have been avoided if electra just announced there was a problem with eca withdrawals on coinhouse when coinhouse first made the electra team aware there was a problem instead it took them over a month to even acknowledge a problem and countless of investors fell into the same trap i did

again my goal with this post is to make electra better i am not placing full blame on them but the reality is this could have been avoided for many and this is the type of stuff that burns investors on a coin i want to see eca succeed and hopefully they will do better in the future

zzzz may pm

it doesnt still have a problem all the coin of some value are most likely gone so the standard email you received just means they cant send because they dont have any eca left to withdraw eca team cant actually help because the top priority for cm is hiding their identity and not to be found so cm doesnt respond to anyone may be the just opened eca withdrawal for ca month feb til second half of march to gain time to prepare for an exit

lol another one who knows nothing probably you sold at the dip and now you regret it so much and your foolishness makes you write only crap

i know noone who has lost a single coin all those who had ecas at coinmarket were and are able to withdraw them i only know ppl who have earn money


great team awesome community

whitewalker may pm
i never bought eca on coinmarket nevertheless it is very strange that just eca only open for withdrawl and the rest with high volume like bitcoin ltc will not

so if you have no idea then you better stay out and if you want to spread untruths here check out eca twitter then you know how many have not yet received their coin and the electra coin cooperates with cm to 

and what about the thread here
httpsbitcointalkorgindexphptopic

do you think this pages were created without a reason

dont lie and finally tell the truth electra coin coinmarketcom scammers forever

 electra coin team
i hope your life ends up like many others who have lost a lot of money through your shit with coinmarket you are useless forever even if you give your coinmarket coin back to everyone no one trusts you anymore

knatseb may pm
most coin are being enabled for withdrawal and eca was the very first coin to take action about that never read to any of the other alt teams doing a thing

and yes btc ltc arent able to withdraw and i havent said that cms is a trustfull exchange but eca has nothing to do with it and as i said i know noone who has lost any ecas from cms some ppl has lost btc nd ltc like me and im still patiente thinking that ill ever recover them but blaming eca for that is just nonsense and you can actually see how much has eca grown so far and if you were participating as a member of the community and fallowing all steps they r doin you wont be saying that cause you would be aware about mosly everything and the transparency of the team

btw that thread is about cms its oooooolder than accusing eca for having something to do with cms when it crashed
cms is a crappy mosly dead exchange who screwed many ppl imo i agree but i dont agree with you about blaming eca on that

probably someone did a test send using your address for whatever reason

coinmarket doesnt allow any withdrawals of coin with any value anymore eca withdrawal practically ended late march if you still have a balance you get an email automated that well basically there arent any coin left so your withdrawal fails although its not officially disabled

how much coin i need have for comfortable staking and what is 

gallows may pm
is your wallet up to date sometimes if it has not synced with the network it will falsely show no balance in the wallet make sure that your wallet is getting connections and that you are using the latest version as i think they have released a NNO one recently

as for the staking question currently it is but that could change you will also need a lot of coin to stake frequently it took me months to get a stake with k coin

eca stacking is for whales only
unless you have a many mil wallet you wont get anything

i was staking eca for month and no luck
estimated wait time goes like day than than and than and never less than day

network weight grows too fast i assume so only whales benefit

just look at richlist there is guy with eca staking some every two hours

so unless you have millions not a chance

how can i use my walletdat file to recover my coin in the NNO wallet as it doesnt have a dat file like every other wallet

did you change something in old wallet location when i installed NNO version i assume it automatically sniffed the dat wallet info from previous wallets folder and imported the coin to legacy account in NNO wallet this is just assumption but maybe something to try out

any chance i can use my walletdat file to recover my coin

thanks

thats clear but where is the help debug console in the NNO wallet
or is there some other way for the access




goodhabitmay pm 
there is no such thing in the NNO aka desktop wallet if you want functionalities that you would expect from a decent wallet dont use the NNO electradesktopwallet
you can always start the qtwallet if you have a recent copy of the walletdat and the coin that you had at the NNO addresses will be there if your system is fully synced just the labels like purse checkings and savings will be missing

litebit is based in the netherlands and almost the same like coinbase they just offer much more coin and for me its very easy to buy coin there directly with fiat money the only thing that they should add on the platform is the possibility to pay with credit cards

i beg to differ and frankly you make such brazen allegations without any substantiation or reasoning therefore reasonable to conclude you have an agenda unless you are able to categorically provide compelling evidence to the contrary and back up your post

for me personally eca is one of the most transparent and honest projects out there no surprise it has such a large dedicated and vibrant community please take the time to check out eca discord sorry you feel the way you do but it is most unreasonable to post what you have without any rhyme or reason for your statement eca has so much going on and such positive potential ahead there are regular engineering calls that include updates and the reality is completely opposite to your post

unfortunately people would rather seek to blame others instead of taking responsibility for their own mistakesactions the down side to making people solely responsible for their own money is that victim mentality will become prominent

maybe theyre investors trying to accumulate at low prices or perhaps they legitimately dont understand the basics of wallet security and market cycles

its honestly mind boggling that people manage to come up with such bizarre stories instead of seeking to better themselves

by the way the community of the electra project is slowly growing the addition of NNO participants is always important for any project as well as its development itself
i think the community will be interested to know about the NNO partnership

NNO partnership unifox has formed a partnership with electra project
unifox will implement eca in atms pos terminals and local exchange with this electra will provide its user a NNO way to access to its currency while helping unifox to spread knowledge and build the business around the world

announcement

we are hard at work with the current planned fork we have however decided to delay the release by another four to eight weeks because the product needs further unplanned modifications to improve its stability as this update will affect every single electra user we feel it is best to be prudent and not rush deadlines by sacrificing quality this delay will not cause any changes to the current user experience or staking our community can enjoy the staking until we complete the fork below is a summary of the expected updates and the progress made

completed 
reducing block time to minutes
addition of api calls such as gettxout and bip
staking reward to note this is up for discussion so may be changed again we must consider this once again for the benefits of our project and blockchain lifespan

to be completed
security optimizations this is of utmost important to always ensure security is topnotch
readjusting of the difficulty retarget so delays in block creations are set to a minute interval
qt wallet fix fixing wallet crash on initial launch

we are aware that the above changes are delaying our initial planned release date it is however not ideal to have too many forks and feel that this one should be done correctly otherwise we would have to plan for another fork in the near future we will keep you updated with more details in the next few day and again we thank you for your patience and support

specific questions on the staking
 im sure the initial investment has been well covered since the time your capital expenditures were covered who has received the benefit of the staking rewards
 is there some kind of condensed accounting available to view the total staking rewards received from the premine expenditures etc
 whoever received the staking rewards whether it be eca or e have they in turn been staking those rewards thus compounding the rewards or have they been selling them off
 what is the total compounded amount currently being staked as a result of the premine
 previous discussions mentioned premine wouldnt be staked how many day would you estimate both the NNO premine and the compounded stakes have actually been taken off the network over the last months
 with current supply being beyond critical why hasnt staking discontinued
 if e is the benefactor of all the staking rewards the compounded rewards isnt the fork delay which he was in charge of getting done in his best interest what will his plans be with all the additional staking rewards hell be receiving due to his own delay
 how will the dire supply shortage be handled eca will be out of supply before the end of when will you decide to tell us what has been decided

for a community that claims transparency you have very little real substantial information available for investors anyone with math capabilities can see eca in dire staits but were being kept in the dark on purpose any questions about any of the above in discord or telegram result in being accused of spreading fud being banned i created an account and am asking in here because it seems like the only place to get real answers


	
sjtjuly pm
hello i know k coin is nothing when it comes to staking eca but was wondering if million coin is enough to stake and get a reward at least weekly just trying to figure out if this coin is worth staking and investing in for the purpose of staking can someone share their experience in approximates at least thanks

nakashujuly am
with million of coin rewards are paid roughly every day

boberjuly pm
true and that means with million coin you should receive a reward roughly every hours

sjtjuly pm
alright thanks for answering my question so if million coin should get a reward every hrs or so lets even say hrs why would a pool with million coin not staked yet after weeks the pool is stakeunited

johndoejuly pm
you can choose not to stake your coin thats why

altinvestorjuly pm
are you sure stakeunited is staking properly they could be doing something wrong that many coin probably should have staked by now if theyre not moving coin out at random

knatsebjuly am
i have wondered the same but i prefer to be optimistic and wait the weeks they said till fork is done

after that if the fork is successfully applied then staking reward will be reduced from to with several other improvments

if the fork isnt applied within these time it wont be taken well for the community



kahleenjuly am
the million coin from stakeunited have not generated reward because the assumption that m coin generate reward every hours is simply wrong after generating reward it takes hours for the coin to mature again before even starting to stake again i can tell you for a fact that m coin generate reward roughly every weeks on average with a maximum of weeks but you need not worry if it takes longer to generate reward the reward will be higher according to the network weight so its like this wait weeks to get x reward or wait weeks to get x reward the only downside in the last scenario is that the x coin you would get after weeks could have already started staking after week whereas the coin you get after weeks will only start staking after week 

altinvestorjuly pm
current circulating supply b
average daily interest at staking rounded
they announced up to month delay so even only weeks staking over this time is potentially billion more coin in circulation
that makes circulating supply b when they fork
cap is 
if they offer for a year after the fork staking during that time is potentially b which leaves us with b in circulation year after the fork
while these numbers dont take non staking wallets into account they also dont take compounding interest into account
what theyre claiming isnt possible when you do the math
the question is how are they going to fix it and why arent they telling anyone
another good question when i invested in this i was under the impression it was a community coin and that the community got to vote on decisions at least thats what it says in the wp why is none of this up for a vote why is nothing up for a vote why is none of this even up for discussion let alone a vote
im not trying to start fud just trying to get some answers to some really big provable problems with their claims and their math


colxplsjuly am
the issue with electra is that theyre touting partnerships with atm companies in ico phase now the ico itself isnt the issue the issue is staff are saying it has an existing use case but in reality these will not be available for a year at least and thats assuming that funding is met the final product does not exist

so why do two existing atm ventures need an ico the simple answer is they want to raise capital however initial atm fees could cover this alone and why would someone be willing to use these companies when they cant even get a simple linkedin url to work on their ico page weve been delaying the fork and b company for months now and the roadmap keeps getting silently changed in the background better off waiting until this bottoms out and the team finally decides to reveal the partnerships

furthermore you have people like aykut baybas master den claiming that the team is solely concentrated on providing a use case and that price action is secondary to this if thats the case then we wouldnt have team members making contradictory statements like timing of NNOs release is key in reference to releasing this long awaited NNOs in the bull market rather than right now this is speculating that retail fomo investors who do not know any better will pump up the value

another thing the premine and all the other large holders are still staking at rewards this is going to leave us with a bare minimum of b circulating supply before the fork is finally sorted out and thats assuming the team actually sticks to their promises this time around

seems highly reminiscent of xvg back in its hayday in fact i even recall sunerok mentioning electra a while back


eca has gone from being a legitimate community project revival to a project fueled by greed
hyped up vaporware

johndoejuly pm
 i dont see them touting them as existing use cases even their press wire says this

electra eca announced today that it has partnered with the unifox project unifox will be electras second collaboration of the mass adoption campaign this partnership will entail the direct listing of eca upon the unifox network of payment kiosks atms as well as their pointofsale pos terminals the unifox network has a global reach incorporating over atms and over pos terminals in the initial stages



altinvestorjuly pm
that clearly says has a global reach and makes the rest of the sentence mean they already attained those numbers during their initial stages hopes to have or will have or aims at would have made it the truth have makes it a lie

after weeks still not synct does anybody have a solution 

colxplsjuly am
it appears that the team is simply dismissing this as fudnegativity reality check there would be no negativity if there was competency
regardless of how you attempt to paint this picture the facts remain that the people in this project are still spreading misinformation about it in an attempt to prevent more cumulative losses from occurring

we are constantly told the fork is ready and that the electra foundation would take day to set up well why are we taking so long to implement both of these measures its like waiting for winter to arrive on game of thrones might i remind everyone that the initial founder is to receive all the staking rewards which is closing in on m eca now

staff tell us the project is doing great but nothing has changed since december except for the NNO adoption of this garbage unprofessional approach to marketing attempting to hype and sexualize a finance product with blonde bimbos lacking any kind of cryptographic literacy is terrible at best why on earth would anybody put money into that how does this provide incentive to use electra as an every day currency or have we now switched our target audience from every day families to college frat boys

we should not be sending people like cassandra hawkins electra spirit to institutional blockchain meetups she has a degree in homeopathy and fitness ffs


 stake reduction delay
 foundation delay
 funds still not moved into multisig wallet
 NNO core team silent
 github activity stalling
 founder keeps all staking rewards
 overseers ryu vergelife eca giraffe and zarag gone moving onto NNO projects
 team opening bot party chat for sponges
 team offering their consumers money to win exchange votes
 price per unit below satoshis
 false atm announcements
 openly shilling aircoin unifox and other vaporware ico products in chat

where do you see this going


altinvestorjuly pm
you got a few things wrong
e is staking far far more than m think more in the b range
you only listed the community overseers that have left and missed the really important ones that were the real drivers and backbone of the project
eca momcore teamglobal coordinator she was a total driving force in the team it seems to me nothing has been done since she left
ivancore teamlead developer his title says it all his name has been removed from the github
maverickmarketing coordinator the only one trying to keep the community hyped and positive

e needs to do whatever he can to try to get some of these people back its a huge red flag when key team members and long term supporters leave the team in droves

johndoejuly pm
here is mavericks statement

i have received lots of inaccurate private messages in regards to me leaving the team this is unfortunately true however i want to be as transparent as possible to prevent any further false or possible statements from others moving forward

yes it is true i am sad to say that i had to step down from the team please forgive me as i do not feel comfortable disclosing personal information at this time this has nothing to do with me going to another crypto team or the electra project itself


im a huge believer perhaps one of the biggest in electra this is something i never thought would happen and im truly upset more so than you would ever think

just know that im very proud of the electra community and all that you have accomplished most importantly the individual respect and comradery amongst members please keep up all the hard work and stay dedicated to the project

ribokujuly pm electra is about to announce its first atm pos partnership of which eca is targeting atms and poss globally i think the value of the eca token will increase in the future

altinvestorjuly pm

old NNOs it was an ico so it might be big NNOs if this other company succeeds and those s for atms and pos are company projections for how many they hope to have in or years
this announcement was worse than an announcement of an announcement its an announcement that only stood to do things try to get people to invest in the ico and try to make it appear like eca was actually in a viable usable partnership
i wish it wasnt true but it is
its the equivalent of my claiming to be a millionaire now because im invested in crypto because someday its going to moon







colxplsjuly am
every member that left within the same month said it was for personal reasons im calling bullshit now nobody would announce problems about the project after departing its just not realistic to expect anyone to do that ivan one of the core blockchain developers has left and even aykut has gone on holiday key members have departed from the project the fork has been delayed and the funds still remain in electras wallet staking for his own personal gain why exactly does this person deserve hundreds of thousands of dollars when he initially wasnt even interested in getting involved with the communityproject

hell were even seeing paid shills come onto the btt to dilute some of the criticism going on here this is an act of desperation



altinvestorjuly am
paid shill of the project by a non english speaker in 







altinvestorjuly am

🤣🤣🤣🤣 this is so sad and obvious hope eca team isnt paying too much for this crap every post that asks a real question or brings up a valid point is followed by amazingly similar comments in horrible english

colxplsjuly am

poor business practice

robofusjuly pm
its ridiculous aykut went week on holiday and came back today 

i am not against the negative opinions but hey i prefer not to answer when i see the critics since the beginning of the project
yet there has never been a real reason for fud electra in year and a half



altinvestorjuly pm
great aman then you obviously must know the answer to why e is still staking the premine the capital expenditures he claimed to be staking to cover were covered almost a year ago he keeps all the stakes personally and he was in charge of the fork you dont find it a direct conflict of interest that he personally is making thousands of dollars a day in staking rewards by delaying the fork
read back for pages what you call fud are very real questions and concerns that you are personally refusing to answer why wont you answer real questions
you give the same disrespect to everyone that even dares to ask questions and accuse everyone of spreading fud when they just want answers difference in here is you cant ban anyone which is what you do to everyone in telegram and discord who even dares to ask a question
the supply is going to run out before the end of this is math not fud but you expect everyone is just going to ignore it because you dont want to talk about it when exactly is the core team going to acknowledge this how are they going to handle it are they increasing the supply lowering the staking if they lower staking its going to have to go to next to nothing and then what about masternode how are they going to pay masternode anything when theres no supply were just supposed to invest or hard earned into a coin and trust that the team will magically fix it the team thats lost three core members in weeks mom ryu and ivan plus other important long term team members like crypto life maverick and zarag i thought we were a community coin i thought there was supposed to be transparency whatever is going on is a complete cover up from e continuing to stake almost a year after he recouped his to the amount hes actually staking over billion coin to the maybe change that has to come because of supply to why about half of your key team members has quit in the last weeks
aman i hold you personally responsible for out and out lying to the community bullying and banning people who try to find out the truth and continuing to mislead everyone on whats going on youre hurting tens of thousands of people who are invested in this people with families to support kids school mortgages but you dont even care your only concern is keeping eca going no matter how many people your hurting or how many lies you have to tell
the only team members i respect are the ones whove left
at least theyre answering the questions honestly when i dm then

robertsebastianjuly pm
i see a lot of negative and bitter comments from your side in this eca thread mr colx

i am able to counter every concern youre raising but first i think everyone should understand here that the comments you post are not coming from a constructive mindset happy to enter in a conversation or discussion with you if you want

let me tackle all points you raised below

 the atm manunfacturer unifox already has capital and working atms they need to raise additional capital to expand as they have huge goals set for themselves as you may have seen they met with the american blockchain association a couple of weeks ago to discuss possible cooperation for installing k atms that the association is planning to plant in the us
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpxijjemkqhkts

 as you know but not explain below the fork wasnt planned on the roadmap only the atomic swap integration as the devs concluded we need to change the staking algo as well as improve the chain it was decided to plan the fork as you know but not explain here e is working hard on coding the fork and unfortunately had to delay the fork from happening last month weeks ago e confirmed the fork would happen in to weeks any releases from the roadmap can only be released after the fork as we want to avoid duplication of efforts the bigger partnerships with real companies willing to accept eca sa payment method we have been working on and are working on behind the scenes will only be released after our product electrapay is released and for electrapay right we need the fork to happen first

 aykut and the team dont focus on price correct we believe that a good usecase a solid product and an engaged community will result in a good price so the price is not the aim its a result as we are all volunteers our incentive is of course eventual price increase as a result of us doing our job good if we see another bull market as in end we know that thousands if not millions of people will enter the crypto space and of course we hope to lure them into the electra community to buy electra become active as community member and of course spend their eca at shops where its accepted usecase the effect achieving the above by announcing all we have in a bear market will be way less then in a bull market as such not everything will be released right away and you know what if you hang out in the community the vast majority understands and agrees

it is correct that the premine is staking and that is a choice e made for the investors big or small its their own right to choose at this moment i am working personally on setting up the foundation which i expect to happen in august once the foundation is set and the first portion of the premine is deposited mln the foundation will not stake that part of the premine
also bear in mind that eca is a pos coin and therefore has no hardcap once the fork happened the staking percentage will drastically decrease immediately and all years after

eitherway i admire you put so much effort and time in looking into electra id encourage you to investigate more and be complete in your comments about the project my second advice is to spend all your enrgy and time on positive things in life it gives you more joy and satisfaction i promise you that

all the best

hello anonymous keyboard warrior why dont you let me and the people here know what you actually like and it doesnt need to be eca i dont expect that from you i assume by looking at your name your projects logo is green eitherway i commented where i could on your incredibly short sighted comments a weak attempt to convince people why eca is the worst project you can possibly imagine

again perhaps we can do a live qa online where you have the possiblity to fire anything at me and for me the noble task to counter all you fire with facts

quote

it appears that the team is simply dismissing this as fudnegativity reality check there would be no negativity if there was competency you are the negative one here 
regardless of how you attempt to paint this picture the facts remain that the people in this project are still spreading misinformation about it in an attempt to prevent more cumulative losses from occurring what misinformation

we are constantly told the fork is ready and that the electra foundation would take day to set up please show me where its asid i told the community this week that the lawyer adviced day when we submit the forms well why are we taking so long to implement both of these measures its like waiting for winter to arrive on game of thrones might i remind everyone that the initial founder is to receive all the staking rewards which is closing in on m eca now discussed it before

staff tell us the project is doing great but nothing has changed since december except for the NNO adoption of this garbage unprofessional approach to marketing attempting to hype and sexualize a finance product with blonde bimbos lacking any kind of cryptographic literacy is terrible at best why on earth would anybody put money into that how does this provide incentive to use electra as an every day currency or have we now switched our target audience from every day families to college frat boys we are now months underway my friend and in a bear market we are doing great if you see where we are coming from and im not talking about price 

we should not be sending people like cassandra hawkins electra spirit to institutional blockchain meetups she has a degree in homeopathy and fitness ffs somebody from the team works in swimmingpool industry we have people working in drywalling industry i work as banking consultant we have students mav is in real estate etc etc and you know what we are all passionate about the project and know a lot about he subject matter where some are maybe more technically savvy then the others


 stake reduction delay no deadline set
 foundation delay no deadline set
 funds still not moved into multisig wallet what funds
 NNO core team silent github activity stalling some activities we dont disclose in the open on github to ensure it remains hidden for competitors
 founder keeps all staking rewards no e is also hedging eca with other crypto
 overseers ryu vergelife eca giraffe and zarag gone moving onto NNO projects maverick joined ruru joined robert bakker joined ryu is till with the project but not in the team zarag same
 team opening bot party chat for sponges serious
 team offering their consumers money to win exchange votes 
 price per unit below satoshis yes 
 false atm announcements why false
 openly shilling aircoin unifox and other vaporware ico products in chat its not shilling its talking positive about partner projects

where do you see this going a purple future

colxplsjuly am
strange that you would take this personally and yet again dismiss this as negativity do you have some undisclosed control over the project that we have not yet discussed you and i have been in the back end and eca influencers telegram group for quite a while we both know eachother well and we both know that personal reasons arent why maverick eca mom ryu ivan and cryptolife left the project

consumers dont blindly spread fud they ask questions fud is false information and you know full well that what im saying is not false
when investors are given vague responses that are engineered to divert attention or confuse for months at a time they become frustrated a prime example is your clear attempts to dismiss me as a keyboard warrior and redirect peoples attention to me rather than giving answers about electra

remember that day when we described ourselves in eca influencers as a group of people who have a hard on for getting eca to lets not bullshit anyone on this thread were both honest individuals and should keep it that way all conversations that display a direct conflict of interest were saved just in case something like our current internal issues were to ignite

 price manipulation
 buying false social media followers comments and likes to assert influence over other projects consumer bases
 coordinated hype in the lead up to announcements
 backend conflicts

 
 the list goes on

i will object to your proposition of a qa as the last one we coordinated with aykut on youtube was pointless and i know any adequate responses would be considered a conflict of interest aykut gave the exact same vague answers to our questions with only an emphasis of its a good community coin

see last failed interview here
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbqwwptynsts

we dont need words we need action

robertsebastianjuly am
i dont take it personal but i do stand for the project where none of the current team members have bad intentions as you suggest

i have no clue who you are since you keep yourself anonymous therefore i cant verify if we ever had contact or not but thats ok

maverick did leave for personal reasons and he can even return as soon as they have been resolved i have called him many times in the past weeks and had intensive contact in the past day the fact you state he didnt leave for personal reasons tells me you have no relationship with him nor ever talked to him yet you state it firmly which makes your posts less credible as its simply not true

eca mom and ryu left because they dont agree with the power e still have from a developer perspective in the project as well as the control on the premine which is understandable these kind of projects stand or fall with trust as long as i believe and trust the good intentions of e i have no reasons to doubt i will stay but i can imagine when you loose your confidence you leave the project you di dforget to mention that ryu and eca mom are still active as member in the project ryu is doing an awesome job in helping the community in answering questions cryptolife wasnt very active so never had any chat with him and ivan also was not very active so didnt talk to him a lot in the past months and has his own ambitions to achieve his life goalsdreams chat with them to understand

based on these conversations i wouldnt describe the both of us as honest people since i noticed you only post onesided and incomplete stories if thats on purpose its being dishonest if you believe you speak the truth in making the comments then i cant blame you for being not fully aware or informed
in the eca influencers group i cant recall a day where we said to make eca eur and i find it typical you try to throw these statements to me in a way the reader even may think its true i and everyone in the team have the strict rule to not focus on price in terms of predicting price can never be predicted or set as goal as it is dependent on many ingredients from which many cant be controlled

i would like to inform everyone reading this thread that the person im responding to who refuses to identify himself clearly has grudges to the project or feels not respected in the past a lot of statements or theories he or she writes are either taken out of context or untrue i can tell from the posts that his person was not directly involved in the coordinators team but watched it from the outside and thats okay id like to challenge everyone to use common sense do their own research and by all means verify information directly at the source

master den bob the revolution asmoth myself and more are working for the project many hours a day where most of us have still fulltime jobs we wouldnt do this if we didnt believe the project has a future did you know master den spends hours a day for already a year on this project for free where he gets regular offers to join other projects as community manager for serious amounts of money a year

yes we have quite some bumps in the road to overcome and these are discussed a lot of times in the teams and community yes in the young team that we are we also have internal struggles between people just imagine trying to setup and run a project with people from all over the world that dont know eachother work together only through mailing and having calls some people came with different intentions then others
what i see now is that the current team has a big passion for the electra project and its community to play a significant role in the cryptoblockchain revolution all projects are currently being part of

again yes we all have our bag of eca some were able to buy very soon and have big bags some have smaller bags bought at later stages such as myself if i may speak for myself i made my crypto portfolio exist for out of eca to keep myself sharp and motivated to keep on going for the project

you may disagree with what you see or hear in regards to the projects direction but dont disrespect he people that are working hard voluntary next to their jobs with the best intentions yes sometimes there are community members or even supporting team members that dont behave and have corrupt intentions but those are being dealt with right away
as far as you concerned mr colx i have no idea who you are and when we ever discussed stuff i understand you became disappointed or perhaps hurt within the team if i was a reason for it or some of the coreteam members i want to apologize for that again i want to invite you for a discussion or qa and that doesnt need to be in public perse
if you dont want this then i think its pointless to continue because the conversation would become very one sided where you post incomplete comments placed out of context me countering them leaving the public in confusion what to believe

take care and all the best

eca incredibly pleased to announce that one of our NNO developers scibot is returning welcome back scibot

coinmasterjuly pm
wonder why a guy with name colxpls is fudding so much about electra 


vanovijuly pm
in my opinion the electra communitys rejection of the ceo and the central body is a very bold and NNO decisionand the fact that decisions are made by the community collectively and always in the interests of the community is very progressive

altinvestorjuly pm
dont let the hype fool you the community has no say at all in anything thats done why do you think nobody not even core members can tell you whats going to be done about the supply shortage they have to wait for e the owner in every sense of the word he has all the assets he gets all the income from the assets he has final say hes the owner


johndoejuly am
same reason why a boy with a NNO name fuds this thread constantly anger empty pockets who knows


johndoejuly am
about the same as how much you charge for your fud lol

altinvestorjuly am
fudfear uncertainty and doubt yes i definitely have all i invested a lot at least to me in this project i was led to believe it was a community coin and that id at least be able to ask questions and have input along with voting rights what i see instead is a community falling apart key people quitting and any questions meet with banning or being accused of funding
my questions shouldnt be hard to answer maybe its not important to you that the supply is going to run out and they apparently dont have any idea how theyre going to deal with it but as an investor it matters to me any day now they could announce a decision that could dump the price that matters to me
key team members leaving in droves all of a sudden matters to me theres something wrong and theyre hiding it
the founder whos supposedly not the owner keeping of company profits after claiming to only be staking to cover matters to me
i unfortunately bought high so dont have the luxury of just dumping my holdings i do however remember reading that this is a community coin my questions deserve to be answered and i deserve to have my vote counted on the direction eca takes as its stated in the white paper
we all do
its time more of us investors stood up and demanded our rights our right to vote our right to have a say a right to have our questions answered
not ridiculed or accused of spreading fud because were asking questions

kiddojuly am
i know what you feel brother i invested at a peak in other project and i am in the same situation unfortunately you cant do nothing about it the only thing you can do is waiting because if you dont sell you dont loose anything another thing is to remember dont invest what you cant affort to lose

coinmasterjuly pm
come with your NNO idgrow some balls and dont come as NNObiedont fud unnecessarilyevry coin is bleedingin comparison to that eca is standing tallteam is working hard

sumitmathurjuly pm
report the one who is creating fud

robertsebastianaugust am

the documentation to setup the foundation lies with the lawyer firm next week i expect to have a meeting with the dutch tax authority to proactively engage them with our plans in the articles of association that will be published after the go live we will unfold our plans on how to ensure the community is represented in the board and especially in the decisionmaking process

secondly the entire team exists of community members joining and sometimes also leaving e only works on the blockchain its the team existing of community members that eventually decide the path to go one example i can give though is from earlier this year where we had a nonresponsibe exchange yobit while we paid the listing fees we made a community vote on discord and eventually the community decided to withdraw our application

of course we still have to grow as team and project and the community engagement especially how this is going to be done has to develop as well our community governance team has the task to shape and implement this again first big step is the foundation

	



robertsebastianaugust am
most of your statements are false or out of context i will comment in red below quoted and commented in red


altinvestoraugust pm

thank you robert you are the only one in the team to acknowledge my concerns and give me at least some answers while i disagree with a couple of the opinions i respect you for treating me as an actual investor with valid concerns
it would be great if other team members would follow your example and treat investors with the same professionalism you have shown
great NNOs on the foundation formation and i will indeed be listening on the call today
thank you again


robofusaugust pm
yes we thank robert

the only problem is that when there is always the same question it is difficult to manage and only the fork will reassure people who are afraid 

i advise you to read at least all the messages electra to understand the project and if you can read the whole subject even if it is long it is even better

only electra message httpsbitcointalkorgindexphpactionprofileusashowpostsstart

starts with the end for the oldest first

good luck and try to understand the interests of what comes out of the panicfud now that the price has fallen and not before 



kiddoaugust am
congratulations for the shardax listing guys devs and community members keep up the good work as it was until now you are amazing eventually eca will hit a top exchange is just a matter of time because the developement of the project is good the community is good

geobullaugust pm
eca will be huge

electraaugust pm
thank you for the fast action electra the btc funds have been received by me and converted to eur via coinbase
the funds will be fully used to pay the lawyer notary address registration translation of the articles from dutch to english server cost to run the wallet for the funds etc
all made cost will be in the bookkeeping of the foundation once established

robofusaugust am
this is great NNOs for the foundation

thanks electra and robertsebastian 


johndoeaugust pm
sounds good the foundation and electra are both set up to grow

jerrykjamisoaugust pm
eca excited to announce yet another milestone in our ecamassadoption campaign

eca now available for integration with general bytes atms in over countries stay tuned for more exciting announcements for eca by following us on twitter facebook discord and telegram

alaugust am
excellent good job 


johndoeaugust am
looks great cant wait to use it in person and get electra


argakiigaugust pm
updated NNOs from stakeunitedcom 
NNOs regarding electra eca eca is a low roi a year long term project with a current coin supply of eca in our pool the biggest input right now is around eca but as you can see this is still a relatively small amount compared to the total circulating supply these facts lead to the point that it takes around weeks for the eca wallet to get a stake reward we talked with many community members who solo staked eca before using the pool cu and they had to wait months for their first solo stake so weeks is already pretty quick like stated in our faqs withdrawals are processed every hours if a stake was produced we always try to have a reserve for withdrawals as well to do withdrawals even if a wallet havent staked yet but obviously we cant destroy an input which matured day already just because of a single withdrawal exceeding the reserve please use multiple small eca withdrawals if you want to withdraw eca before it generated a stake reward if you dont like to wait for eca stakes feel free to look into all the other coin in our pool most of them generate stake rewards once an hour thumbsup moneybag rocket 
this seems to be good for eca developers i feel happy

themonkiiaugust pm

great thanks for sharing i tried stakeunited for eca but was told in the discord chan that they had stopped it but it seems like that was misinformation
i can say that i hit a stake about every day with a balance of mill

ill send some over later and try again

	



dandanaugust am
hi this coin not have masternode and what is next plan to make this coin grow this year any NNO exchange is planned

thuesdaybaugust pm
whats the difference between checking savings and legacy account

johndoeaugust am
legacy account is the qt wallet account checking and savings are different accounts on the NNO wallet



cjcryptaugust pm

what is the use case for eca sorry i been searching around on website and missed it i guess


johndoeaugust pm
it is just another fast coin right now other than that some stores accept eca

jacekaugust pm
nothing special coin normal like others

gamichvocheaugust pm
nice ico but planning is not well established

nothatinjusttrollinaugust am

swap is just a way for this special problem if they didnt want to airdrop currency it would be easir decisions no matter token or NNO coin
my opinion is devs should use my eca for that but also add feature to keep their token safe on my eca so people dont need then to send eth address right away if they dont want
myeca can be built a multy functional platform in time if devs decide it and see it fit in their plans


rcvlielandaugust am
eca did not have an ico we encountered the issue that we needed to fork the blockchain in order to realise our roadmap therefore there is some delay at this point but we communicate openly about it



colxplsaugust am
 

remember when the electra team said maverick left for personal reasons

surprise surprise they lied yet again what happened to the day of transparency

you cant really blame him for leaving for another project though it would be very frustrating trying to deal with an incompetent and deceptive business team theyve done a pretty good job at keeping people holding while the max cap and inflation controls havent been implemented just a reminder for investors that the longclaimed billion eca max supply is actually false and is actually unlimited until the hard fork is released also dont forget that the recent business partners are run by team members

it appears that the most recent deceptive business tactics are to have team members create a NNO startup company remove their faces from the electra website and announce a partnership lets not even get started on tekin akdenizs admissions of spoofingbotting the charts on cryptobridge during the previous dump the sec is going to have a great time with that one

this is endorsed shilling enabled by individuals such as robert bakker and aykut baybas

 maverick joining NNO team also displays that he founded the company most recently announced on electra forums
httpstwittercomevimeriaiostatuss


kiddoaugust am
tbh i dont care about a dev who left for another project it happens all the time on this space the good thing is that the project was not abandoned and is still working and developing further as about the max supply my personal opinion is that this is actually a good thing with no cap because when youll reach max cap and you wont get the of what you hold many people will sell and leave because no one is staying here for just the fees which is only dust

johndoeaugust pm
lol he is an advisor he is still an advisor whoosh

kolinkoaugust pm
we are pleased to announce that eca will be listed on the cryptocurrency exchange coinbene during the first half of september their top ranking with a volume of over mday will be a huge step forward in our ecamassadoption campaign



electraseptember am
yes i can confirm the NNOs about coinbene is correct payment for listing was made from the premine coinbene is a transparent exchange and despite its short existence became the highest ranked exchange in the world during june and has remained in the toptier since this achievement it is truly fantastic that electra will in a few day be in a listed on a class a exchange which currently has daily volume at the same level as bittrex and higher than poloniex

btcseptember am
great to hear the NNOs from you because you are thinking a lot for the community most of the companies will not bother about the listing in good exchange but you are listing in very good exchange for trading

	

aileenxeseptember am

i think so the ecas achievement will make it profitable for investors to invest in this project the community has strong project support the coin will rise

	



jordancaseptember am
the very name of the topic already speaks for itself and that is all said i think if the team succeeds it will be very popular in the market itsimportant for the community

coinmasterseptember pm
yeahthats great NNOs for eca and eca community

i miss her purple aura but i like money more

johndoeseptember am
i have never used coinbene still only want binance when

robofusseptember pm
no information on binance yet
it will have to wait the fork and electrapay to attract binance 




shastusseptember am
so im positive that eca is now listed on coinbene thats going to be in the near future and it does not have to be that binance is always considered the best exchange

i think you should give coinbene a chance 

shumanseptember pm
hi there

what about mvp and integration eca to the pos and others payment terminals i thought this token will innovative decision in the cryptotoreal world but as i see the project slowly limping somewhere behind the competitors

coinbene isnt necessary step right now there are a lot of markets with eca honestly dont understand the reason for listing

best wishes

robofusseptember pm
its not the same team that takes care of being listed everywhere
and the development team

being listed on coinbene will allow people in asia to easily join electra

awwad michaelseptember pm
project seems very hot i want to know when the bounty campaign ended your bounty business looks very tempting i try to look at the effect because of the best conditions provided by the team

eroltseptember pm
i hopedthought that the volume should be much higher as it is right now on coinbene 

goodhabitseptember pm
why should it be higher people who know electra and want to buy more could do so at cryptopia and other exchange a large exchange can reinforce a ongoing pump if many people mostly motivated by fomo decide on short notice to buy but to get to a pump you either have to win a lot of attention or have real whales pumping the price

kolinkoseptember pm
at long last we are thoroughly pleased to announce that the first phase of the hard fork has been scheduled to happen at block due to block lengths affecting time its better for accuracy to provide the community the block number as to when the hard fork shall occur with that being said we urge the community to make all necessary arrangements before this block is reached which includes updating your wallets to latest versions we are anticipating this wednesday for the release of the NNO wallet updates both the qt the NNO desktop wallet will be supported in the fork in addition the process of notifying exchange and other platform have begun please keep an eye on our website for further instructions coming this week current staking of will remain until the fork even after you upgrade to the NNOer wallets

links to download the NNO electra qt wallets v have been added to the op and to the electra website upgrading to this version is a top prority for all electra user credit for this version goes to the developers of mycellium and ruru development coordinator of electra

you can view changes here
httpsgithubcomelectraprojectelectracommitsmaster

mhseptember am
electra

to show the trustworthy of this project you should have a linked in profile as many of the other team members already have this would probably prevent people from calling eca a scam and give NNO investors more trust into the project its just for the reason that there are a lot of projects out there which are only made as a scam and people often look at the teams and if they are registered eg at linkedin at first sight

of course thats just my opinion but maybe you should think about it

kolinkoseptember am
eca now less than blocks away from our upcoming fork at block 

please ensure that you have upgraded your wallet to v to ensure there are no issues after the fork has completed

all wallets at httpselectraprojectorgwallets have been upgraded for the fork

btw the videos links doesnt work it says this video has been removed by the user

victilumoctober am
i cant get the NNO wallet to ever sync active connections are 

here are some observations

i can tell it reads the old walletdat just fine since the recent transaction appear in the wallet but with zero confirmations

i tried adding in the config file i found here

httpsdrivegooglecomfiledypbzrlfzyqgghoduqkvuocfpview

and here
httpselectraexplorercomstatus

 but when i start up the wallet that file gets rewritten with a shorter addnode list
it gets rewritten whenever the wallet is restarted so there seems to be no way to hold any NNO addnode

while hovering over the little globe i can see that there are zero active connections but on one occasion i did see it change to a active connection for a split second then it went back to zero

i can ping some of the addnode on the list like and they give a reply so my pc is connecting

the machine is running win bit 
the processes that are running are
electradwiniaexe and electra desktopexe three of these

 but the wallet remains with zero active connections and therefore no sync

the old wallet had been working fine for me up until a few blocks ago

hi there

i dont understand opinions like this if youre blaming project and say that its a scam you have to provide a very serious evidence in another way your post doesnt carry any sense
eca a quite good project not the best but not the worst and obviously you havent done any researchvisit the site social media read wp etc
yes the things could go much faster we all waiting for mass adoption just keep patient and follow the NNOs and please dont spread fud and nonsense

thank you

anyone here interested in electra classic or whatever its name might be

prefork chain can still be synced i get peers if i do so and all of them with wallet version so there might even be more people on the prefork chain than on
the actual one block production still around per day as before the fork

so im wondering did so many people miss the fork or are they actually hoping to start a NNO project

if anyone is reading this who actually runs a prefork wallet id be interested in a feedback

the code already changed the reward is about annually instead of 

max supply will not be reached for a long time

and most importantly it reduces sales pressure drastically controlled sales pressure is the key to a healthy price increase especially with the second part of the fork and electrapay

it happens if for example the computer reboot itself for an update thanks windows or a computer crash

the daemon in these cases is not closed correctly thats the reason and in more specific cases with the upgrade to NNO blockchain first time the upgrade is done

if user have this error regularly best to use the qt wallet for now both are the same in fact

electra shell empty
its been month since i lost all my investment on eca
ive been supporting this piece for a year because i was seduced by its community which has since become considerably weaker
i have for those who do not know yet lost more than million eca corners from this moment i asked the support of the community the founder the ambassadors or the animators of the recent foundation but in vain
all this will have resulted in me realizing that this piece takes the direction of a big shitcoin
 community at halfmast in fact it is mainly composed of megalomaniacs who have invested nothing and only benefited from the super rewards bonanza and who dream of becoming a millionaire
 a founder totally in darkness who with his premine and staking related to it billion pieces aims to be a billionaire
 a socalled foundation a big word for some people pushy without any means and dependent on the possible generosity of a founder adventurer
 no concrete project except the promise of a big partner imaginary or false for months good intentions certainly with an electrapay atomic swap that fantasies already existing on many other currency
 some socalled partnerships without big interests that apart from ads or editing photos not the slightest sign of conventions or contract
i totally assume my losses for which we will never be the reason or the mode i dare to hope for a hacking even if nothing reveals and not a conspiracy because yes i can be given a little easily my confidence to important members of the community
this message has no purpose of revenge or anger but only my feelings after a month of investigation
my only regret is to have supported this project finally empty of solidarity i will have to follow the few unique and real investors who have left the tub for a while

i am neutral on this issue i will not intervene in the blockchain to support or block decisions made regarding this electras blockchain is open source and anyone can change it but can only ensure their version becomes the main chain by achieving majority support if a majority of user wish to intervene and fork to a version of the blockchain where this person had their assets i wont stand in anyones way

to my knowledge there is no way to know that the million eca by this person was transferred intentionally or stolen

the personal attacks on me the team our community and electra itself are unjustified and uncalled for as a lot of us have tried to help

this person has stated to me that they shared their wallet info with others for help increasing their staking rewards if you want to be safe never do this even if it is me or someone from the team asking for it this applies for every cryptocurrency not just electra

if you want electra to remain competitive in the longrun i urge you to support the foundation the foundation is legally obliged to support and promote electra and the more assistance you provide the more you and all user will get back from it

what do you suggest that the developers must do about the fake volume on fatbtc they dont have any power to stop it because they dont run the exchange the only thing that the developers can do is to ask the exchange to delist eca so the project to not be associated with them in any kind but this the fake volume is a good and a bad thing a good thing is that eca have more visibility due to the exchange position and a bad thing at the same time as you said people will avoid a fake volume exchange at least the big investors

 scam ive been asking these questions and no one can answer them even core members

 why is e still staking he has millions of eca wtf

 why is ruru the only dev thats active ive asked for the contacts of other devs but never get an answer why because there are none or its being outsourced if the devs are being outsouced then heres the big issues

 the outsourced devs are getting paid with eca who then dump it back on to their community remember that big sell off makes sense
 or the devs are paid with btc but who is paying them i dont see e paying or asking for community contributions oh wait

they just asked for money because ruru had to pay for some server bills lol there is an expense for running a business this just shows that electra cannot last longterm since they are going to keep asking for money or voluntary help flawed business model especially when e has millions of eca unbelievable

 masterden keeps talking about NNO exchange or partnerships over and over again wtf just pay for it and get listed this is all bullshit because eca is voluntary so where the hell would they get the money to pay for the exchange exchange all accept btc so they are selling on their own community to get listed or are just lying to everyone

its not hard pay the exchange then get listed

no wonder it takes months for them to release something

open up your eyes and now e is on mandatory military leave right before everything is supposed to be released you have got to be kidding me



lightinoutdecember am
there are no developers go into any project and you will see developers talking and giving updates to the community

electra only has ruru unbelievable ask them for the contact or names of others then also see how fast you get banned or they tell you to talk to ruru

i dont want to talk to ruru

they want to release atomic swaps mobile wallets electrapay and all this stuff in december but i can only talk to ruru what kind of a community project is this

wake up people

gawleadecember am
i dont know if the project is now dormant or not but i know that a couple of months earlier i have joined their discord and i saw a lot of activity in there maybe they are working behind the scenes as many core devs dont have time to talk to the community also they have a community manager for this or maybe i am wrong and you are right i dont know what really happens inside the project but the best thing to do is to join their discord channel and talk to people in there about the development of the project and ask for any info that you are interested in

all you are doing now here is to spread fud and maybe the project doesnt deserve it
why the fud is bad for a project when is moving slowly or the price is down well because the investors will come in here and read about it so with fud you only can make things worst just my cents

cheers g


lightinout
december am
ive asked robert ruru aman and masterden to provide the contact info of other team developers besides ruru they never give me an answer their discord is full of people trying to get access to a rain room so they can collect eca then sell it for being active write stupid robotic comments and talk to themselves to remain active again go look yourself nothing like it was months ago with a real community

ask the core team yourself and see what they say i know plenty of devs in other projects that are at have a role on discord they say they have a team or devs but are they not a part of the community

lastly their community project manager is ruru there was a tweet that said an electra c dev finished something please tell us who that dev is cause i have a lot of questions for them ive never seen any devs in discord or telegram dont give us the bs that they are too busy coding or dont have the time to talk that will just show their priorities are not towards the community

its not fud when its true ask them yourself


lightinoutdecember am
look what happened to them this year

ivan the lead dev left

fork gets delayed

absolutely nothing done or released until maybe december

something is happening behind the scenes and the core team is not being transparent with their investors or community

they either have no developers another delay luckily found some volunteers why havent we seen them interact with the community or they finally started paying someone to fix this mess

heres the problems with the answers above

 more delays

 they found volunteers but they arent active in the community that goes against the project

 they finally decided to outsource the work where is this money coming from they can only have electra or bitcoin to pay for this either option involves hurting their own community

they have to sell electra for btc or they pay the work in electra and im sure that gets sold cause they want to get paid lots of stuff being released in december and lots of recent dumps what a coincidence

ruru is asking for money to cover vps expenses why doesnt e pay for it if he doesnt then they expect the community to cover everything

now e goes off to military service big exit scam coming or announcements wont be what you all expect the project isnt even sustainable if they have to keep outsourcing the work where is the money coming from

these are all questions investors should be asking themselves

its not fud do your research and stop listening to what they keep telling you same story over and over again

lightinout

putting so much energy into creating false information is wonderful thats how the manipulation works you expose false truths to frighten people and make the price drop in order to be able to fill our bags at lower costs so classic 

so you said that ruru is the only active dev wrong oops ruru is the lead dev so she talk about the dev for the team as ivan earlier this year same thing

she works with another dev on electrapay the first part is done and testing right now for this test in real conditions she had to setup a specific server via aws if you know aws you know it can be surprising in term of cost

about the fork e explained it clearly he was in charge of it had some problems finding a competent team his error was to not communicate with the community team about that agreed on this point

then a team member found a team of dev who accepted to make the fork with us e handle the payment of the team on his own funds the first phase was released and the second is currently in test btc core update as and others things

if you are smart enough you can see the fork progress on github still it is necessary to know how to use github


about the recruitment announcement its for the next step of the project i think you can understand that the next release is not the end the project gains in technical growth and offers therefore in human need to correctly carry out the whole project

no need to be a scientist to understand that 


in summary there are actually dev working on the current stuff and a external team about blockchain stuff and its only the ones i see myself so its not a restrictive number of course

i understand you its easier to spread false information than doing serious research and good idea to create an account especially to spread all your false stuff its very credible 


sorry if my sentences are not perfect its not my NNO language




robertsebastiandecember pm
hello anonymous person

you sent me a twitter message from your anonymous twitter account past hours wherein you asked for contact details of our devs
you know crypto is all about anonymity in fact youre operating anonymous where i chose to reveal my identity and now you ask for the identity of devs that work on electra that sounds a bit strange doesnt it if people decide to stay anonymous we should respect that

at this moment we work with internal as well as external devs to complete the work for electra in fact as you may know from the past e was responsible for the fork and still pays the cost related to hiring external devs working on phase and phase fork this is all coordinated by ruru

also what you should know is that we have the code in our private github just like with phase and when were ready to go live with whatever we want to release it gets pushed to the general github

eitherway you have no right to claim to speak to the devs they have more important things to do then defending themselves to someone accusing them andor the project from false behavior or scamming

feel free to continue here or whereever or conscience is clean and once the code is pushed into the github youll see what work has been done

finally yes the past year was hard for us and some people left in a matter of fact getting good devs is hard and dont even start about getting good devs willing to volunteer thats why we are gratefull and extremely happy ruru is with us and coordinating both the internal as external devs as well as finishing electrapay herself

once e is back he paid off military service and in his country it means you only have to serve weeks he will be able to respond to you but it wouldnt surprise me he doesnt find your comments worthy enough to spend energy on
but about him dont forget he paid for exchange listings he paid for dev work on the fork phase and and he already donated mln to the foundation where the remaining mln come when he gets back

youre not NNO in fudding or calling stuff fishy or related to exit scam and you certainly wont be the last

robertsebastiandecember pm
everyone and lightinout

id like to close this topic through below message as i noticed that one of his tweets confirmed he is the same person as botero on discord who claims to have lost mln eca and holds the project responsible httpstwittercomlightinoutstatus


lightinout also known as botero on our discord claimed to have lost mln eca without him being at fault as such he contacted the team to compensate him either through forking the extra mln or ask e to compensate him
as we always state in our disclaimers that we are never responsible for usage of our products andor loss of eca our answer could have been short but we took the time and investigated this matter together with this person our userupport team and other team members spent hours and this matter was also discussing times during our team meetings

the end conclusion was that the wallet from this person was not flawed and it was visible that the transaction was made after insertion of the password
see below the official response from the userupport team on behalf of the project towards his claim to be compensated

botero after much testing and discussion and over many discord sessions with you with a number of our team members we regret to inform you that we are unable to reimburse you at this time for your coin reason stated below the wallet is working has normal though from your perspective this may not be true the coin were sent and received in another address this is normal function for a wallet as to how those were transferred though we can not confirm that as that is the case to any transaction you stated that you have encrypted your wallet with very strong encryption this alone would stop coin being sent only if the encryption password was used other way coin can be sent is if they have your private key which a encryption password is not needed to add it to a wallet but is needed to dump from the wallet if the wallet is encrypted
in our conversations with you and our team we have noticed there was no bug or flaw in the wallet in saying this there is no way to prove if coin were sent wrongly out of the wallet by another user or yourself eca has one of the best tech support and these are the conclusions we have come up with we are not here to guess if the coin were accidently sent to the incorrect wallet or if coin were sent correctly and the user does not have access to the NNO address we also are fully aware of bugs that can be in the wallet though in your situation is not the case due to the coin being sent and properly on the blockchain

thank you for your patience as we look and take each of these with dedication and want for all our user to have the coin they deserve we did setup a channel just for you situation for us to discuss and you were brought up a number of times in team meetings with a number of hours for a number of support and dev personnel in trying to solve your unfortunate circumstance as you have shown we also understand that you may not agree with this conclusion and decision but these are the facts at hand if you have any final questions please feel free to ask but do note that this is our final decision thank you


everyone who still has questions can contact the userupport team or myself on discord if people wish to help botero lightinout by donating to him i suggest to visit either discord or contact him directly loosing crypto is something terrible and unfortunately happens regularly

best regards
robert



lightinoutdecember pm
theres a NNO thing called kyd know your developer

apparently the electra team does not want to tell us who their developers are

im glad you at least admit that youre using external devs why did it take so many months for the team to finally hire someone can you give us their contact info or the name of the company youre using no reason to be anonymous if they are a legit company investors should know who is working on the project

im sure the electra foundation will have to disclose where money is spent lets start now or are we going to say e payments are different sometimes the foundation pays and sometimes e pays for anonymous stuff

electra is a community project yet no one wants to volunteer do you all expect e to continue paying for everything you already have ruru asking the community for money to cover vps expenses why doesnt e cover her expenses

robert you are the most honest and respected person on electra team why do i now see you involved in so many different telegram projects also clearly investing in some of them you used to be electra seeing you investing and being part of other groups makes people question your dedication

how much electra do you even own im sure you will have to disclose this information if youre part of the foundation just like stocks of a company the investors and public should know how many shares you have



lightinoutdecember pm
there are developers are they in discord or telegram what are there names

external team about blockchain stuff what kind of stuff im sure blockchain is basically the entire damn project do you know who this team is

why is electra even hiring external people to work on blockchain stuff those same people will work on other projects or are already doing it are you using freelancer website to find people how do we know quality of code team member cant check quality if they cant even code it looks good lol


icathtradedecember pm
do you know that you have the answers on this topic

it seems that you didnt do enough research


lightinoutdecember pm
where robert says they are anonymous that is the answer

the electra foundation is hiring anonymous developers so much for transparency and community efforts

you apparently know who the devs and external blockchain people are can you just tell us

that would really give me and everyone reading this the answers to this topic

morfusodecember pm
it is very clear you know nothing about investment foundation stock company or personal investment or whatsoever and you just try to create fud but this is old fashioned everything you try to dig has been replied through social channels engineering calls clearly

so please spend your time for better things

your transfers were investigated by the team where it is clear there is no bug inside the wallet so remaining are you trying to cheat the community you sold your coin or transferred your coin to someone and asking reimbusement do you think this is logic 

morfusodecember pm
crypto hiding in definition if you dont know go and learn secondly the team is transparent even this is not a must under cryptology definition

and once again electra is not a company electra was not an ico and it is been more then years until today

lightinoutdecember pm

 please tell us how you see electra partnering with darkpay coin an anonymous crypto project that doesnt even have a team page do you know who is on their team i see you active in there and buying why not buy more electra

 you are saying electra is a currency not a company but the foundation is a legal entity or company you should discuss this with the other board members next week investors will want to know how much electra foundation board members have i know i do

 ruru needs money to cover vps expenses you are asking the community to cover that with eca she needs money this means the community will donate eca to ruru and she will go sell it on an exchange to liquidate it to pay for bills the community donates to hurt their own price please answer why e doesnt pay her

 i dont want the community to donate electra to me if they did then it would get sold back to them this is a flawed project and will not last you cannot continue paying for work by community donations

 will we see another post like below one day

example 
we want to get on another exchange please help us collect in eca which we then sell back onto community because exchange wants btc

example 
there is a problem with atomic swaps we need to hire dev for to fix it please donate eca so we can have it fixed since no dev on team can do it

your project devs and e directly dumps on and hurts own community





lightinoutdecember pm
the electra foundation is a company and has a board of directors

board of directors should disclose their holdings

why should i or anyone trust a company who has board members that do not disclose there interest

at least we will know all of there names as that should be public

morfusodecember pm
 electra is a community project
 electra foundation is not a company go and educate yourself read some information make some research check the dutch law about foundation 
 electra foundation board members are responsible against dutch laws and the funds which are received to official foundation account
 electra foundation members are visible and not hiding themselves like you 
 if you cant realize the differences nothing to say you further


this crypto space really needs more educated and honest people for its future cleanup will hapen one day but it seems it will take more then expected 

lightinoutdecember pm
the foundation is not a legal entity then what is the purpose of having board members just elected friends hanging out and talking about what to do with m eca premine which was not even received yet

morfusodecember pm
boy listen

foundation 
a foundation also a charitable foundation is a legal category of nonprofit organization that will typically either donate funds and support to other organizations or provide the source of funding for its own charitable purposes


company 
a company abbreviated as co is a legal entity made up of an association of people be they natural legal or a mixture of both for carrying on a commercial or industrial enterprise



 i said electra foundation is not a company foundation company both are fully different entities

you dont read you dont want to read you have different intentions which is clear and we all know this this is also my last message and cant waste my time to take you serious

good luck

lightinoutdecember pm

still waiting for the contact info of the devs and external devs that are working on literally everything thats supposed to be released in december saying they are anonymous is not an answer

if something goes wrong then the core team or ruru is going to start asking for donations again to pay another dev to fix the issues who will then take that eca and sell it back onto the very same community that donated it

will ruru hold onto the eca donations sent to her for a specific time or will she sell it immediately im sure the community would like an answer to that one they can adjust their buy walls to help her sell off

its great to see so many people join in on this discussion



robofusdecember pm
if you are afraid that kill the project you can send here you can contribute via paypal here ruruelectragmailcom

lightinoutdecember pm
id rather watch everyone give their eca and watch her dump it back onto her own community

e should be giving her that little 

thats just the start wait till more expenses show up


loweyboydecember pm
i dont think i remember seeing on here such a bitter person as lightinout dude its time to drop it now you are just making a fool of yourself everyone can see what you are trying to do its not even subtle anymore as at the start of this thread where you at least tried to subtly lay down the fud it was only a matter of time before you were outed as botero and you speak about being transparent hypocrite


lightinoutdecember pm
i dont need your donations or sympathy

none of you know who these external devs are that are working on the electra blockchain

i find this hilarious fork phase can have so many bugs and you will all have to continue donating to other devs to finish the project it starts with but lets see how long ruru stays with electra if thats truly a crazy expense for her guess time will tell

robofusdecember pm
you didnt understand
 represents only aws rental charges amazon server shearch google aws to run large programs such as electrapay this does not pay developers who work voluntarily

lightinoutdecember pm
apparently the external dev team is being paid by e

ruru also has to pay for her expenses this means her voluntary efforts are now costing her time and money

im starting to wonder if ruru is voluntary or if shes getting paid shes been part of this project for over a year and is starting to ask for money thats not a good sign


gawleadecember am
ok first of all note that i am not holding any eca i had some in the past so i am not holding their part nor i am paid for any comment by eca team

second i want to apologies as i have not explained what fud is fud fear uncertainty and doubt

you fear that the project will fail because they delay the development well dont be this is common in crypto there are big project like ethereum with a lot of developers and contributors which is delaying the switch from pow to pos for almost a year now tezos have delayed the launch of the mainnet more than months with developers biggest project outside cant sometimes keep up with the development

as for the eca funding well if they have sold half of the premine at lets say sats they would have made btc so they have a lot of money for development

what makes you think that the devs will give you their identity or contact info if their decision is to stay anonymous this is crypto in the end and the main reason that we all are here now anonymity


altfeederdecember am
based on the listing at coindeal with our agreement there was a contest for top traders and prize distribution coindeal listing was free of charge based on a voting and we won it now we must distribute the prizes to following eca wallets from the foundation wallet

lightinoutdecember pm
electra is supposed to be a community project robert keep saying they have all these teams but there are no active devs in telegram or discord just ruru you can be anonymous but at least engage with the community

now he is saying they have external devs working on the blockchain guess electra isnt a community project anymore why no one wants to volunteer for this project look at ruru requesting money this project wont last if they need to keep paying people and expenses there was no ico and the bonanza people dont care or people donate eca which is then sold onto the community for btc funding ouch

why wont robert make a tweet saying their team is all external and paid for instead he makes it look like they are part of this community project that is not transparent

look at cryptopia distribution chart you have huge and recent bag holders just wait for them to dump on all of you


lightinoutdecember pm
robert

httpsmobiletwittercomrobertsbstatus


in our project the developers are close to the community easy to reach out to and take the time to explain their views in videos like this



they are so easy to reach out to can you please give us their contact info all i keep seeing is ruru 

id like to talk to a dev other than ruru

now everything is external and anonymous

but all devs are close to the community and easy to reach out to

just cant talk to the devs e has hired to work on phase of the fork the most important part of the project

lol what a joke


loweyboydecember pm
ou shouldnt guess lightinout thats what probably got you into this mess in the first place and in any case why are you so worried you soldtransferred all your eca and then tried to scam the team and got caught out i dont really see any point you keeping up with the charade as everyone already knows the truth

lightinoutdecember pm
what am i guessing who the devs are

no one should have to guess who they are

now they are external devs that are paid by e lol

happy with the project the concept is good and which gives good pos


lightinoutdecember pm
he concept of hiring anonymous devs for a community project is good

going from to pos staking is good

you are all brainwashed or was this a paid shill post

robofusdecember am
ok you want fud because you hate to have lost your money
but how do you explain staying on electra with a pos before your loss

and then say
going from to pos staking is good




lightinoutdecember pm
going from to is crap your anonymous e couldnt edit a few lines of code in the blockchain

could have changed the percentage months before phase but he killed the total supply

lots of whales bought in for masternode but now its impossible to implement them

this project is not meant to survive long term

poor ruru is giving all her time and paying to help electra how much eca does she have unless she has m then she will give up soon as its not worth it keep asking your community to invest and pay for devs or expenses


robofusdecember pm
you are no longer credible 

you dont answer 
why did you keep your electra before your loss at of stake and not 
and now you criticize that

lightinoutdecember pm
credible for what


 e is anonymous

 partnerships are delayed for months if they even exist

 exchange are delayed remember masterden saying exchange and all that bs in early 

 fork delay all when e just had to edit the percentage in code idiots

 entire project has total supply issues

 electra has no funding devs are asking community for donations why e not pay it

 what does mobile wallet have to do with fork delay just excuse same with other delays

 you have active devs that are easy to reach out to but not the ones e has hired no transparency or trust

 all core members have blocked me on twitter i can still view accounts by logging out 

 already saying q for things that were supposed to be in december



electra project has a team that hides information from their community

ivan clearly messed up the wallet and you still released it

knowing that there were issues


robofusdecember pm
lol ok 

but you dont answer 
why did you keep your electra before your loss at of stake and not 
and now you criticize that

germsitedecember pm
but is that an overall positive sign or is it just more about the general market than it is about electra

dear electra community we are pleased to inform you about our project httpselechatstop which logs all important telegram chats related to electra we believe that electra chats will be a valuable addition to the electra ecosystem during the work of the site we have already received a large number of positive feedback from community members the project is under active development the project has its own team of programmers ready at any time to solve NNO technical problems and make NNO improvements

what is implemented at the moment
you can read your favorite sites in a convenient form for you through httpselechatstop
the site is optimized for work and on mobile devices there is a search by keyword and date it is possible to read the chat you want in your native language using google translate the translation is not perfect but it will allow you to receive the latest NNOs as quickly as possible from the first sources for example you can use our site to read chinese dutch or russian versions of electra telegram chats

in the near future we plan to add the ability to share a specific telegram post in social networks on the one hand this will allow you to share interesting content with your friends and subscribers and on the other hand it will positively influence the development of electras popularity in general

there is a lot of work ahead we have planned a huge number of interesting and useful improvements if you have any suggestions for improving our site please write we will try to take everything into account and use it in the further development of the site

if you think that some important chat related to electra is missing on our website please write and we will add it

developers electra relaxed a bit and do not show the proper result i do not know what it is connected with we hope that the developers will more actively communicate with their community

boterodecember pm
after reading the last pages since my speech on november th thank you to those and especially to super robert for having assimilated me to lightinout
however i thank lightinout for having built much better than me the hidden scam that is eca
however i do not need to hide behind another nickname to warn potential investors or rather future victims
yes it was necessary that members of the community steal my wallet and it is well to remind him to realize the trickery that is this project
useless here to recall the fundamentals that do not exist lightinout does it better than me
flee is my only advice 


boterodecember pm
it is very surprising to note that on the tweet of lightoutin who also claims to have lost million pieces my lord robert answered immediately by times except me it was necessary to revive several times to finally answer day after 
i am not the first person to have lost his pieces on this project what is it of the others bring your testimonials that this scam stops
i also suspect that master den e and company are the same person who is hiding behind this masquerade 

lightinoutdecember pm

o funny you say the top havent moved in more than months


did you notice that first distribution wallet went up an extra eca lol

	


lightinoutdecember pm
none of them do any research into their own project they just repeat the same stuff over and over again

how many kNNO that the anonymous e has hired anonymous devs to work on the next fork

but they all say their devs are easy to reach out to and talk with the community lol




icathtradedecember pm
everyone knows it its been said and said again

you seem to be the only one who dont know read this topic again please you missed a lot of information

icathtradedecember pm
i confirm i have found the information and the name of the dev team

lancedecember pm

you should maybe listen again to the engineering calls and read the backend updates

also why do you reply to your old account 


morfusodecember pm
 important 

as the coding for phase of the fork is completed and under the testing period we will soon start announcing the block number and an estimated time for such
please follow our announcement channels closely during december in order not to miss any important updates eca eca




lightinoutdecember pm
and who is this anonymous team

robofusdecember pm
but you dont answer 
why did you keep your electra before your loss at of stake and not 
and now you criticize that

this is the th time i ask the question and you still dont answer



milugaudecember pm
it is too soon to enjoy active trading on nova exchange
i think that investors should wait to see how the nova exchange perform next weeks before sending the electra to the platform for their tradings




boterodecember am
also why do you reply to your old account huh

that things are clear i do not know who is this lightinout has he also lost his wallet i do not know certainly if he insists so
i do not need to take refuge behind another nickname to express myself botero is easy to identify because i use it everywhere
all these barren debates of who is not interested in me what i know is that my pieces have been stolen and i am sure that it was committed by a member of the community
since this loss i have inevitably asked myself a lot and realized after my investigations that this project is full of uncertainties and managed by incompetent dreamers
free to everyone to continue or invest in this deceit
i blindly carried this project for year and today i have to denounce the scam and i would do it for a long time

ive asked rober asmoth ruru and masterden who the easy to reach developers hundreds of times but they dont answer then robert says they are external team the anonymous e has hired which shows they dont even know who their own developers are

this timeline is hilarious cant wait to see if there are any test delays everything is supposed to be done right lol

you have problems reading i think 


but you dont answer

this is the th time i ask the question and you still dont answer
lightinoutdecember pm
this is the type of people defending electra you dont even know who i am but you keep asking personal questions idiot

this is the time i have asked for you and core members to tell us all who these easy to reach and community developers are

it looks like electra has a core team that does not tell their community what they are truly doing and they dont know what is happening because there is a second team that is made up of developers that only e has access to since they are all anonymous


you get angry that i dont answer your question because you dont even know what your own project is doing

lightinoutdecember pm
im sure you have more than m eca now i am also sure you got all of that at sat or less so you can sell at a profit

judging by your post history and french messages i bet you have also spoken with ivan and the french eca community that constantly dumped on everyone

keep asking stupid personal questions but dont answer questions about the project you supposedly support

lightinoutdecember pm
electra you can rest assured that our developers have the highest credentials utmost integrity and have had their identities verified for the good of the project and community

wow cpollo verified who e is and all the anonymous developers that he hired

what a joke cpollo just lost all their credibility by issuing this certification 😅

i will message them to ask for info lets see what they say


lightinoutdecember pm
ou cant make this stuff up


 i looked at the cpollo white paper and it says all team members must submit to a know your developer kyd process that includes identity verificatio n residency verification and skill verification

robert wrote they choose to be anonymous just like yourself e and many others in crypto

how did cpollo verify the anonymous e and external devs working on electra robert doesnt even know who they are lol





 i asked robert how much electra do you even own and he said this is not a respectful question and also not relevant and all you shillers said eca is not a company and blah blah blah

to get cpollo certification they say require members to provide their wallet addresses

was that not respectful and relevant to cpollo but not your own community






as per their certification cpollo must know the identity of e all anonymous devs working on the project and their personal wallet addresses


if this is true why not share the same information with your community are you not a community project


why does cpollo have access to this information but not your investors



lancedecember pm
again you are misreading too much things
they ask the team to provide payment wallets and not personal wallets as stated here from their registration form
you looked at the wrong section you were looking at the part for projects that want to launch an ico on their platform


lightinout
december pm
httpsuploadssslwebflowcombbadbefdcabeabedeacefacpollowhitepaperpdf

look at section cpollo approved project vetting

the vetting process is similar to all projects applying to the cpollo platform with more comprehensive additions the vetting process involves the following but is not limited to

all team members must submit to a know your developer kyd process that includes
o identity verification residency verification and skill verification projects must submit the following documents

plus

o onepage project overview
o whitepaper
o certificate of incorporation
o list of coin or token allocation including addresses of all development
wallets and team pay wallets

 

so electra team told cpollo who e is or at least the external and anonymous devs that robert said they hired

team pay wallets to me thats personal wallets of the core team perhaps they should word it differently

i find it hilarious that you all continue to argue with me when you dont even know who your developers are or how much eca the core team owns

altfeederdecember pm
attention electra community 

yesterday round gmt eca has been transferred from the foundation wallet address

these funds have been moved as compensation to a community member due to a bug in the desktop wallet this bug was active in may during the desktop wallets initial release this bug was fixed immediately in few hours after it was detected

the bug essentially was that when transferring eca to another wallet address the total amount would be used as a fee following the detection and correction of this bug there were several announcements to our community announcing a mandatory wallet update to address the issue

our community and its members are always trying to improve the ecosystem of the electra project and provide userfriendly tools and systems following this incident our support team learned an important lesson and started testing NNOly developed tools multiple times before release with this in mind we still believe that this is still not enough we kindly ask community members to do their own tests with smaller amounts whenever they download and start using NNOly released software and tools

if you have any questions about this case please contact our user support or me personally on telegram bobvane

tldr this is a onetime reimbursement to a community member due to a bug in the desktop wallet

will read a whitepaper latercan you just tell me if is it possible to stake coin here

lancedecember pm

this year the staking percentages are annually

the whitepaper will be updated soon as well as the roadmap

also youll have to keep a look to the announcements in the next day to update the wallet for the upcoming hard fork

puts them into a bad position since they cant verify anonymous developers

can someone from the electra team explain the agile legal partnership

did you just pay them a retainer fee and now they are a partner or did the firm receive or invest in eca for equity

or is this all pro bono

im sure its just another bs vaporware partnership that they are trying to promote the only thing theyve released all year was a half ass wallet that is filled with bugs now e is called out to military draft yet the foundation still only as rd of the funds mark my words e isnt coming back anytime soon if cpollo is legit and knows who e is then the team should release this info to investors


crytlrd

verification doesnt mean verifying each and every member it means verifying the core team members which are masterden robert bob to name some and even if e submitted his documents for kyc he decided to stay anonymous and thats not a big issue as crypto is not the only think he is dealing with he might have professional life bcoz of which he cant disclose his identity presently

and regarding your stupid claim for why robert not showing his wallet address my question is why he should show his personal wallet address which he brought from his own money the community should be interested in premined addresses and foundation address which they have made available publicly

why should we interfere into someones personal investment when the project is not an ico where team members got millions for free

thank you


crytlrd
december am
cpollo doesnt said anywhere that their approval means a project is strong it just means that the core team members have

 provided the kyc documents
 mentioned wallet address for electra its premined address as its not an ico where team members got huge bag for free


crytlrd
december am	 


they have told so many times in engineering call that company will come only after electrapay is released and the discussion started because of contact of one of the community member so once electrapay is released the discussion will enter the final phase

from december to december they have released

 from exchange to exchange
 desktop wallet
 partnerships with unifox investaco general bytes and one more coming soon unifox already started deployment of atms and investaco already into final beta testing of debit cards
 established foundation
 in it will be added on hardware wallet
 the phase fork will have atomic swaps bitcoin core upgrade and pos protocol upgrade check github for the code and after fork the electrapay will be released

and this are things they did and i guess its good for a year project to achieve all this with help of only community members

if he had to run away he would have done it during the bull run when volume was more than btc on daily basis than now when the price is also down and volume too so this is bs imo
cpollo as well exchange like coinbene all know e as he submitted his documents for kyc of founders but the exchange have policy to respect the choice of people and they wont disclose it publicly documents like this just because few anonymous people asking someone to reveal identity when they themselves have decided to hide their own identity

i think you are just being blinded by the bs the team feeds you

ask yourself if this sounds like a strong project and a good investment

roadmap months behind

e no longer developing ruru had to take control of the fork as it was never going to get done

team had to begthreaten him to stop staking so they could finish phase of the fork before max supply was reached

 due to the screwed up supply from e staking millions of coin masternode will never happen and staking had to be reduced to an amount that is not worth holding the coin

 the primary dev lost her job from working on eca and the team bought her a laptop just so the project wouldnt completely die

 most of NNO core team has left

 desktop wallet filled with bugs

 mill in foundation funds what do you think that will do thats not even enough to pay a listing fee on an exchange

 asking developers to work for free because they have no money to pay

the list goes on and on eca is a failed project and will likely eventually die im sorry but im being honest dont just blindly believe the crap they tell you on the calls there is a lot that investors dont know


crytlrd
december pm
 only masternode is something which is not coming from roadmap of rest all will be released after the fork one by one there will be announcement for fork block number within next few day

 e was never a main developer since the community had taken over the lead developer since the start is ruru and e only looks after the blockchain security and some other details related to blockchain

 ruru is the person since day working on fork as lead developer you need to listen to calls where she herself explained what she is working on

 if you know how to check codes just visit the github and see you will find all masternode code present in fork but wont be activated as for you mn is an profit machine but in technical terms mn is for better security and health of blockchain and fortunately eca have good blockchain and with upcoming atms and pos machine roll out in by unifox and investaco electrapay for merchants we will have enough node running for keeping the blockchain healthy

 yes ruru lost her job because she was working with a bank on a top position and then side by side she is working on crypto project whose primary aim is to shut down banks so i guess you are matured enough to understand the conflict of interest here and reason why her bank removed her

 most NNO core team left lol seriously masterden aman robert bob tekin asmoth ruru jenova lane nashlay studly cryptonaut all are since december and still present

the ones who left were the products of bull run just name the person and you will find they joined after february

 desktop wallet filled with bugs i have an iphone and trust me even after being a trillion dollar company they have bugs in their product and to fix it they regularly release updates almost every alternate month so i guess eca is good enough as all the funds are secured and the bugs are ui related and not technical ones

 million for foundation right now might not be a huge amount but right now they dont even need to use those money for anything so why to worry about it now

 asking developers to work for free i was not knowing that bitcoin pays its developers for working on bitcoin blockchain

a community project with no ico and premined which is of total circulation cannot pay each and everyone and those who have joined know the fact and even then they work on it for almost a year with same passion so why you are worried about it when you are not even working

the answer goes on eca has proved all such fudders wrong and it will do it in future as well with each passing month the community is only getting stronger and stronger and i am sorry but im being honest here i dont just blindly believe the crap you tell on the bct there is a lot that you dont know

they had to hire an external dev company to complete the next fork robert even said that thats why its funny for cpollo to verify them they said it themselves in their telegram group they didnt verify anyone because its a community project and everyone is on the website

i didnt know that kyd means you can just look at the team section and say yup looks legit


you can argue all you want but

you dont know who the electra developers are

you dont know how much the core team holds

your m premine wont last a few months if used for exchange or salary

you cant expect people to devote their life to a project when it doesnt pay them or their bills unless some got in below sat and are able to pay bills by selling their eca

everyone says electra is a community project but has a core set of people making all the decisions theres no open voting or anything to get the community involved with decisions on partnerships or exchange options you have no choice but to accept what they choose to do for you

i want to know the core team members wallet addresses especially if they are part of the foundation how do we know if they are selling or buying before a big announcement

they keep saying how transparent they are but i dont see that i dont see the transparency in hiring external anonymous devs and not telling the community its deceiving to say ruru is doing the development when she is not it looks like it on github because shes uploading their work


crytlrd
december pm	 


 external devs are not fulltime developers that need to reveal their identity they come work and go and verification again doesnt mean each and every person it means of selected core team only which they did

 do you know the developers of btc or xrp or ltc or ada or eth you know because they have mentioned on their website and the same way the team page shows electra team as well

 why we should even know how much core team holds thats their personal holding and not taken from premined or got it for free we should know about premine and that details they have provided

 eca already told that they wont be paying the huge bags to get listed on exchange and the majority work for free as volunteers so salary is only for things when hired on external basis but thats not a huge amount as its work based

 no one is saying to denote the whole life its the beauty of community project one goes someone else takes his place you think in btc people who were in are still working

 even a normal community member can talk and get a partnership till now everything is done by community members and all are partnerships be it unifox general bytes investaco or any other are with help of community members which include core team as well and without any payment for partnerships

 want to know core team wallet address so they dont sellbuy before big announcement i guess all the other crypto projects team members have made their wallet address public and eca is the st team which is not doing it right lol

 why do you want to know anonymous dev do you know all the team members of other projects personally ruru is a lead developer just backtrack those commits you will find other developers as well and the final commit comes from the lead developer who is ruru


listen botero aka lightinout aka dan dijoux you tried hard to scam and get million eca and you failed so you created multiple fake accounts and started fudding and your twitter is blocked already as you used bots so its useless as we have seen lots of scammers like you in past and the common result was all of them failed in scamming eca

the fact that you think ruru has been the main dev all along proves you really dont know what transpired i have screenshots of conversations if proof is needed ruru had to take control before max supply was reached the code was so screwed up she had to work nonstop through the night for day on end just to release of the fork without her the project would have went to zero

and you guys have to stop comparing yourselves to bitcoin yes btc developers are not paid eca is not bitcoin and will never be bitcoin people lose interest when they are not compensated for their efforts

also this nonsense about how mass adoption will keep the blockchain healthy out of all the cryptocurrency none have been able to achieve mass adoption but eca will you honestly think people are going to go to an atm to do an eca transaction and merchants will be flooded with eca payments no the coin supply is ruined due to staking and e staking millions thats why masternode are not possible and staking is so low its not worth holding the coin

i hear all the time if e was a scammer he would have sold at the top bullshit nobody kNNO where the top was and thats why people are stuck holding bags he like everyone else last year thought the price would keep going up so i dont think thats a good excuse

this isnt fud and it isnt trolling its the truth and all eca does is cover up the truth and string people along so the price doesnt crash to zero eca doesnt let anyone ask questions without being called a fudder or negative thats a major red flag

i promised to put an end to this scam and end up digesting my loss
finally having carried this project for a long time and encouraged some to invest in it i must denounce the dubious practices of the members of this community
i have as you already know lost my entire portfolio of million pieces
at the beginning of this adventure a year ago i had all confidence and especially for lack of competence let a certain aykut baybas allias masterden n ° of the project to intervene and take remote access on my wallet to insert the configuration file under mac
in view of the reputation of this person after my last investigations notament in eaglecoin would he take advantage of this moment to steal my dat file and thereafter steal my pieces 
i obviously have proof of what im saying through message exchange between him and me
i have a long time after this mishap tried to find a solution with the management team but without success except that of me banned networks discord telegram 
i wonder if e masterden robert and maybe another frenchspeaking network are not complicit
its decided you can count on me to devote the necessary time to denounce this scam you have my word
small important point a scammer who could have hacker my computer to steal my pieces as it was often mentioned would have had much better to take than my eca portfolio or then would not be satisfied that eca 😉
take me as a troll and whatever you want give me all the accounts that come here denounce this scam but the sad truth is that they stole my wallet and i do not need to hide myself to denounce these bandits

what will you be doing then

it is clear that you wont be a developer since you had to hire external and anonymous team to complete this next fork

dear stakeholders

 eca has been transferred from the premine in order to pay for development obligations involving the upcoming fork




electrajanuary am
i answer your first question in an interview i gave a few months ago
httpsmediumcomcryptogetherbydreef

i do not find it irregular to work with additional developers the project has grown too much to be solely developed by myself if they wish to be anonymous i will respect their wishes the important thing is that the code is open source and reviewable by anyone

we were missing some of the required code for integration with komodobarterdex this has obviously been solved for the upcoming fork as we have successfully completed atomic swaps with komodo


lightinoutjanuary am
will electra have the ability to do atomic swaps without komodo in the next fork


theres over projects that have atomic swaps with komodobarterdex


 httpsdocskomodoplatformcombarterdexlistofallcointradablehtml


how long did it take the additional developers to connect eca with komodo



altinvestorjanuary pm

will this amount be deducted from the m thats scheduled to be transferred to the foundation this week
on the foundationi was under the impression they would be providing some kind of accounting for the funds to date theyve already spent about or approx of their initial funds m from you m from donation wallet with no accounting for it at least not publicly as theyd claimed 
they also said theyd be posting minutes from their meetings which theyve also failed to do 
this lack of transparency or accountibility is really concerning theyve been set up for over months now so the excuse that its NNO i dont think is valid anymore
i think you should reconsider sending any additional funds to the foundation until such time as they can account for their spending and supply meeting minutes 
by all accounts you are more transparent than the foundation and the premine would be better off in your hands 


altinvestorjanuary am
i just saw on discord that robert claims the foundation hasnt spent million which means he doesnt know whats going on or its something he doesnt want known this brings up another question of who exactly has access to the funds and who authorizes or keeps track if robert himself doesnt have a clue the options are
a they have no real foundation control and its all a front for someone else actually controlling the funds
b theyre unprofessional disorganized havent been keeping track or
c theyve transferred funds secretly and gotten caught
i cant think of one good valid reason why robert himself wouldnt know how much has been spent 


electrajanuary am
the million will not be deducted

the foundation statutes state that finance reports will be provided within two months of the end of the fiscal year in their case december

why would you go and say that you hired or paid external devs when it is now clear you were just paying komodo devs


the devs at komodo are not part of the electra team they just helped you integrate electra into their platform

this project lacks transparency

 million is being used to pay komodo devs to integrate electra onto their platform

we are spending million on external and anonymous devs for our next fork

altinvestor
january pm
thank you for your professional noncondescending answer i dont ask these questions to create fud as robert has implied in his response but out of a real sense of concern for the management and direction of the project 
dec th on the explorer shows m transferred out which is unaccounted for on the sheet the team provided you with
my other big concern is that the foundation board doesnt have the time available to commit to the project as volunteers their time is definitely appreciated however it would appear the project could be being held back due to their inability to commit more time its very worrisome that the responses for why things arent done always contain a disclaimer that falls along the lines of were volunteers appreciate what you get we dont have time
is there no way that the current foundation members could assign rights or powers to people such as master den and asmoth who are available more
last question it has been discussed frequently in the past that a way for the community to have more input and voting powers would be implemented but so far it just seems to be becoming more and more restrictive and exclusive to an extremely small handful of people has the idea of a community run coin community voting rights been abandoned just as a for instance the decision to use foundation funds to fund aircoin is questionable at best imo much more effective forms of advertising they could be paying for 
thank you again for your professionalism and cooperation

does aircoin provide analytics as to how many of their user receive eca airdrops via their app

will electra foundation be responsible for maintaining this partnership or will members be required to donate eca to aircoin

robert i have always held you in high regards however your condescending attitude towards anyone who dares to ask a question is exactly why i chose to post my questions anonymously in here instead of in discord where ill be ostracized for daring to question anything im in there daily and see how everyones treated if theyre not cheerleading i am indeed grateful for all the volunteers however being a volunteer doesnt mean youre above reproach or not accountable 
i ask these questions out of concern for the project its called diligence not fud
you yourself claimed in the past in discord that meeting minutes and accounting would be available once the website was live its now live and still nothing is available as youve intimated almost all answers are available if one looks hard enough except for anything related to the foundation it would take minutes to post minutes in discord seconds to post big expenses since the foundation was formed in october i dont think its at all unreasonable to expect some kind of progress report minutes or accounting even if the volunteers are all part time

as an armchair critic backseat driver fudder whatever you want to call me these are things the teams need to start doing again which all seem to have gone by the wayside since the mass exodus of key team members last summer i know someone somewhere is going to reply with they werent key team members but they very obviously were or things wouldnt have gotten left like they have this is constructive advice and is not meant as fud
 back room updates these improved transparency immensely 
 proofreading everything that gets posted on social media the spelling and grammar errors that are regularly in posts now are really unprofessional looking 
 help wanted ads you keep claiming people should volunteer to where the only post ive seen in months is for developers 
 translation team what happened to getting everything translated for a global community
 engineering call agendas
 consistent engineering calls held on the date theyre supposed to be
 engineering call transcripts for easy access
 articles written by eca with pertinent informative content
 marketing has pretty much died what happened to the graphics information updates etc
 current roadmap
 updated whitepaper
 updated team information
 community input opportunities for engineering call content requests

from the time the teams were formed until about july or august almost everything about this coin and its management was impressive even in a down market it was constantly growing and evolving sure it had some hiccups but the team more than made up for it keeping everyone informed and excited on a continuous basis 
having talked to many of the team members that left their reasons for leaving had nothing at all to do with a down market
before you claim not enough time or volunteers my personal suggestion would be to beg the key people who left to come back pay them take up donations use foundation funds whatever it takes just try to get them back the ones i can think of are people like crypto life undertow mom ivan maverick
which brings me to my next point on volunteers i myself would never personally volunteer for this project because of the way the volunteers are regarded after they leave its made very clear that no matter who it is that leaves they didnt really matter and are easily replaceable their reasons are reduced to they couldnt stick it through belittling their contributions and real reasons they had for leaving obviously some of them arent replaceable for instance youll probably never get volunteers again with the same qualifications and abilities as the people i listed above hell you cant get people like them for paid positions let alone volunteer ones 
maverick was one of the most effective marketers or hype expert ive ever seen 
mom had unbelievable experience and seemed to somehow keep it all under control
ivan did massive amounts of development 
crypto life was an expert in pretty much everything and an amazing community person 
undertow wrote good articles and based on everything that was released during his time was a professional proofer 
i dont know who was responsible for each of the things that have been abandoned since they all left but you need to get them all back the only way you can do that in a timely manner is to try to get some of those key people back

staked but orphaned means it wasnt accepted someone else mined the block before you


archetipo
march am	 

so i will not receive the reward for the year stake i did
it seems strange to me that there are no variables to reach the prize but the only condition was to have the coin and leave the wallet for some periods in open stakes


goodhabit
march pm
sorry but you obviously did entirely missunderstand the concept of staking while staking rates are calculated on annual basis staking reward is for generating a block you dont get reward if your wallet is not selected to add a block to the blockchain if your wallet generates a bloc the reward will be calculated automatically for the time since it was deposited at this address and not moved if it staked previously that stake counted as moving coin reward will be pro rata for the time that has passed since last movement but on annual basis

when you deposited your coin on the electrawallet version was still qt and the annualized reward would have been but as you only deposited k coin you would likely never stake because this amount was mostly far to low to ever stake in 

then in the beginning of october a NNO wallet was declared mandatory the version this increased the number of blocks but dramatically reduced the staking reward to annually obviously you missed that update so you continued staking on the old prefork chain as most people and at least most with large wallets adopted to eventually the number of coin that were staked on wallets plummeted and thus staking became easier this is the reason that you did receive a reward of eca on the amount would be correct if would still be the rule as it was on the wallets but this reward this stake only happened on the chain which by most people is considered worthless

now in february a massiv upgrade of the network happened with migration to an entirely NNO blockchain using qt x wallets when you did this update the NNO blockchain only accepted those transaction that would be valid on that chain that is transaction that are valid with the wallet before the second fork block at and this means that all transaction that were generated on the chain after block if i recall correctly are invalid nonexistent on the actual chain

so if you continue staking you might still generate a block on the NNO chain and eventually gain the reward for the full time although only at a rate of annually at the moment scheduled to decrease further the reward is not due at a given date so it will not be paid after the year is complete but whenever you generate a block that is earlier or later unfortunately k eca is probably still on the lower end for ever getting a stake although at the present high number of blocks generated the threshold has certainly come down much

ohh you are back from one more minibreak do you go on a break to think what should be the next move to spread fud

anyways if you can see community developers like ruru jenova and nash are working continuously by staying public and not everyone likes to be in front some prefer to work in the background like you are working spreading fud continuously by creating a fake account and not revealing your identity

anyways as long as project is moving we dont care who is working on the project is it external or internal who cares

the reward is halving every year so it will take couple of decades to reach the total supply

also pos coin have no hard cap on supply not just eca but all the pos coin so coin continue to get added even after supply is reach

we had a guide during the upgrade period but it seems to have been taken down basically

 backup your walletdat file found in appdataelectra do not overwrite it or delete it

 except for walletdat delete everything regarding electra both program files and the content in appdataelectra

 install the NNO desktop wallet run once and close then put your own backed up walletdat file into appdataelectra in place of the NNOly generated walletdat


let us know if this worked for you if not write here to our discord or to httpselectrasupportorg and well resolve this

can you please explain to us how eca was converted into btc for risk management purposes



electra

via an exchange

april am

ohh finally you are back long vacation must say so how are you ready for the NNO wave of fud

learn some NNO tricks on how to scam people from other projects

so not bad lets see what NNO you bring now as i guess you know last time all your trick failed so lets give it a NNO try




freegold
april pm	 

hi all personally i think that eca is doing great work thanks everyone i also think that it is under priced at the moment so regardless of what other fud there is keep up the good work and moving forward

thanks
rick





lightinout april pm
 can you provide exchange and price the was liquidated at

was there a vote by the community to do this



crytlrd
april am	 

ohh so old fudders are once again back

lightinout neptunenice 

how much you will try to get this project unfortunately all your attempts are failing

hope so you have check the past achivements on website if not here is the link httpselectraprojectorgroadmap

and do let me know if anyone is having such strong blockchain or not

also for your reminder etn raised million usd during ico suffered double spend attack polispay failed to implement pos and gave a failed fork

but for electra both are secured with no millions of dollars raised

lol so think again if you still want to try your negativity or people are now smart enough to do their research



robofus
april am
they were sold on coindeal at the date announced at sat on a purchase wall of eca i saw the order in the history

votes by the community are for the foundation not the premine take the opportunity to criticize but it was never said otherwise and it reprensents of market and funds are still for electra

for the moment and for years electra has always respected what he said if it changes i would be the first to criticize him believe me


fsh

april am	 

hi

anyone has requested to show fcas trend graph for this coin

i think that will be a good indicator of the health of the coin

	





electra
april am
dear stakeholders
i have a couple of announcements to make


announcement 
there has been opposition by parts of the community regarding the amount hedged and so a gradual buyback was made as promised expect a total amount of about eca to be transferred to the wallet within hours from multiple sources


announcement 
we are in the process of developing an android wallet for electra there is a tough decision to make

option we can either have a staking wallet with pruning as NNOly promised but due to the recent increase in block size it could potentially take up about gb even in pruned state assuming blocks are full a reduction of our block size or some other modification to the blockchain would be necessary if this path is chosen so that it takes up less space with staking mode turned on phone battery will be reduced quicker also network security may be impacted if people prefer staking on mobile on the plus side you will be able to stake on the go 

option we can have a wallet that is nonstaking and pruned it will take up less space and consume less phone battery than a staking mobile wallet this one will take a shorter amount of time to develop

whichever one is chosen i will consider my long term goal of create android mobile staking wallet with pruning complete so if you have strong opinions on one or the other make it known here i will mainly rely on the opinion of the foundation and stakeholder commentsvotes while making this decision

you may vote for your preference here

pril am	 

i dont know why but i cant vote on the poll link provided i vote option without hesitation at all



electra
april am
try again and let me know if it works this time


icathtrade
april am	 

i cant vote as well on the link

also no staking wallet for sure its a bad idea



electra
april am
i think it is because there is a rule that NNObie accounts cannot vote on polls



apfelgluck
april am	 

ok you should create a poll on discord too


crytlrd
april am

is this your personal initiative or the one the team members are working on

as i see you have your own personal roadmap as well which you see for electra along with a community roadmap

so the above mentioned wallet is from your personal roadmap or the mobile wallets mentioned in community roadmap

thank you

	





electra
a pril am
it covers both



crytlrd
april am

then i will go for nonstaking mobile wallet

using spv light weight wallet it will make sure the mobile performance is not impacted and security of network remains unaffected

so its better to focus more on security that on fancy features

if in future need arises which i highly doubt we can think of getting mobile staking option as well but presently we dont need such

thank you

	







vishals
hello

i am vishal and i would like to inform the eca community member that one of the oldest team member who worked since the very beginning of the project finally left electra project

his name is aman singh

he was among the most respected and trustworthy team member but unfortunately without saying anything he deleted his telegram account discord as well

if anyone post a message asking where is aman or why he left the project the admins will simply delete the message and directly ban the account who asked about aman

there is a censorship going on and for some weird reason they are trying to hide why aman left without saying anything

so i have created an account here so atleast someone can answer what happened all of sudden that a person who was trusting eca so much worked day in day out for the project against all the odds suddenly left the project

what is team hiding with the community that aman found out and left the project

i know some will say i am trying to say negative stuff but if this is not true that aman left the project i would apologize to the whole community

they banned me from main group saying i am sending dms to people if there is censorship in main group and someone like aman left the project i guess we investors have the right to know whats wrong with it if it was not allowed in main chat i messaged few of main chat members to know if they are aware of it or not

so i hope someone will let me know why aman singh left eca

	






icathtrade
april am

from what i see you have been banned because you were spamming user and you threatened to create fud saying it is not a problem for you to do that proof by screenshot shared 

also about aman as it was said no one knows at this time me you and the team he just deleted his social accounts

so before spread noninformation wait for a real answer

i just hope nothing bad happened to aman and he is fine 

	


vishals
april am
lol let me bring the truth in front of you as well then

 your team members are spreading that aman earlier was inactive for months as well after cm which is totally fake you can cross check he was active all the time during and after cm by checking his messages in main chat and in announcement channel

artur said all the above things screenshot can be shared so stop disrespecting a person who have put thousands of hours for the project in last months if the project cant respect his efforts atleast ask your admins to stop disrespecting his commitment towards the project

 i was already muted and when the team didnt said anything about him leaving then being an eca holder i have the rights to message some people in the community and share with them so they can ask in main chat which when someone tried the message was deleted and the account was banned

 yeah i have posted the question for the real answer only

 and aman is absolutely fine that i can tell you so nothing bad happened to him thats for sure



icathtrade
april am	 

of course aman was active a lot he made the NNO website for example i even dont understand what you are saying

and a real answer was given the team doesnt know the reason at this time but you just think they are lying its wrong and just your personal point of view

but well you are known by the whole community as toxic and negative guy in any situation

so continue to do like you always did no problem with that

have a good day vishal 



crytlrd
april am
and who said aman left electra project

vishals april am

then can you please ask artur to stop spreading that aman goes inactive for months and have done this earlier as well if yes then can you tell us when he left the project and if he came back why he was again allowed to join the project as he had left the project already

its not me saying above things it was told by artur one of the eca admin who you remember was banning everyone from tip bot group when someone took rapids name or were there in rapids group

same admin once again spreading negativity against a team member in dm

so he needs to understand st and learn how to respect a team member even if he decides to leave the project and move on

the whole community even know that whatever points i raised are always correct just the way i speak is not ethical




vishals
a pril am

you can check his telegram account is deleted discord is deleted

what else you need to say he left the project




crytlrd
april am
i guess he announced that he is no longer working for electra or atleast told you that he is leaving thats why you are so confident that he is no longer with eca

right



vishals
april am
he same question you need to ask the core team and ask them why nothing is being said about him

the team is hiding something for sure and by deleting the message in main chat proves something is wrong



crytlrd april am
maybe they have not said anything because he never left the project

bdw you know who i am 

and if you dont know then on telegram where you spread all the lies you need to ask one of the admins or team member cryptlrd belongs to whom





vishals
april am
who is he



crytlrd
april am
maybe aman himself 

you say you know everything so how you are not aware of it you made two mistakes which is the worst till day

 using my name to spread your negativity

 and spreading that i left the project




vishals
april am
you really want me to believe an unknown account coming all of sudden claiming to be aman



apfelgluck
april am

coming all of sudden lol look at his messages

	




crytlrd

why not message electraindia on twitter and see if it replies or not now i have logged in and waiting for your message to confirm my identity

here it is httpstwittercomamansinghstatus

i hope you know how to read and also you should now know which account i use before trying to spread negativity

enjoy your fud






lightinout
april pm	 

 
i think it just funny cause you left the electra team before more than one time 



c rytlrd
april pm
i feel sorry for you as whoever is your source for proving such information is giving you incorrect info

you need to change the person so atleast someone will provide the correct info

to correct you i had dropped the roles of core team last year same month that is april but remain team member always 

i have never left electra project and i will never leave electra project

and i guess its normal to ask to remove your role when you dont feel you are doing enough to get the core team tag

i guess thats what community project means earlier when there were few team members i got the core team tag and now when there are more who are working better than me they deserve the recognization and appreciation

so you dont worry for me i am here to stay so please use someone else name to spread your shit

and if you so interested about me lets have a video chat my friend you and me and lets discuss in front of the whole community

i would love to answer about myself when you ask questions about me on video call

will be good to know who you are as you have so much interest in electra so need to know the die hard fan of eca

let me know when you want just tell me the time atleast a day early and i will manage the schedule as per your time zone

thanks





lightinout
april pm	 

 
i would love nothing more than to have a video chat with you

not sure how much questions you can answer since you never do enough for core team tag

let me get all my questions then we can schedule everything

this will be fun mr aman singh


crytlrd
april pm
yeah it will be fun and i will take one more suggestion from your message

regarding checking the identity using photo and present date so will on call do it with our government issued identity

as you say you are or were part of the project so hiding behind a fake name doesnt look good right

lets verify the identity as well mine as aman singh and yours as 

will be waiting for your message 

thanks



lightinout
april pm	 

yes even better

this will be great marketing for electra and community 


crytlrd
april pm
yes thats true

more than me people will love to see who you are

and from chatting with you on discord i will chatting with you on call

will be amazing as it will be going back to 

you can name it as core team member reunion 

so wont be replying any further now whenever you have time let me know we will do it just see my time zone is ist if you dont know
thanks again



crytlrd
april pm
nope i am not i already told you

i guess i should have used former in my previous message

anyways let me tell you now i am not a core team member since april thats almost a year now



lightinout
april pm	 

ok even better since you will have blank look on face

this is community project excited to see how much you know about it and people you support


crytlrd
april pm
yes you dont need to worry about me

i am here to take care of myself 

so will manage how i will look or how my face will look 

i hope now your next message will be the video call date and not something else

and if you want some answer from a specific person you can send me the question for that as well and i will get an answer for you even ready to do that as well



lightinout

but what about electra i think its going to die volume is only k there is hardly no heartbeat
what do you think




crytlrd
april am
hope so you have check the past achivements on website if not here is the link httpselectraprojectorgroadmap

and do let me know if anyone is having such strong blockchain or not

also for your reminder etn raised million usd during ico suffered double spend attack polispay failed to implement pos and gave a failed fork

but for electra both are secured with no millions of dollars raised

there is continous activity on github as well the community is active

the volume maybe low but its same for alt coin and thats not the point of worry as right now its btc season people are confused if btc will go up or remain stable or it will take down direction

see btc domination from to so people are moving money from alt coin to btc to ride the btc wave once settle the btc money will flow in altcoin again

hello

i have a question in regards the eca who was converted to btc how will this btc used to benefit the project maybe for listing fees or at least for marketing

greetings



electra may pm


half of the eca sold has already been bought back as i mentioned before the remainder will stay hedged for the long term this conversion was not done to immediately spend it all it was done so there is a reserve from other sources if needed the reserve will eventually prioritize funding technical development rather than marketing or exchange fees when spent on electra the stakeholders will be notified

i dont see the electra bought back on the premine addresses

is it planned to pay the developers and the electra team for the last update bip bip mobile wallet because for the moment you never announced paying for anything and the team did it on their own

also can we know the exact amounts of the diversified reserve excluding eca

thank you we need transparency and regular updates on the amounts adress wallets

i also wanted to know what you are working on in concrete terms at the moment because i only see technical updates from the foundation and the team and never from you

hello
i have a question
the formula for calculating the award is

 number of coin day unspent 

for example i buy coin and hold them for day

 coin per month

that is after spending for a month i will get 

this is nonsense
what then is the point of buying this coin



icathtrade
june am
y up its that yearly

better than bank interest better than bitcoin better than eth ect you see what i mean
electra is not a coin we buy to have rewards if its your main goal you made a mistake 

also it means as well a very low sell pressure so when the price starts to grow stakers dont dump the price with the stake rewards its a win win


andrey

so the price on the contrary falls more than one year

hodl
june am
lol thats your response but yes thats correct in a glass mostly empty way a parallel example is if you bought bitcoin or any other non staking coin on the planet and a year later its down youve lost with eca you haventyou can frame a hypothetical any way you wantwhats the point of your post eca is a staking coin but isnt designed to make you a lambo by holding coin its a payment system in development with incentive to hold and prevent inflation i myself believe that if you buy a coin and it goes up youre up if it goes down youre down if you sellthat should be all clear now

buy or still believe in this scam is stupid
its been two years since these bandits emptied my wallet of million eca
no need to go back on the method just go back on the thread of discussions also need to repeat that they are not their first scams
you have so many serious projects release this gang of crooks 😉



electra
december pm

we have discussed this issue before

never give control of your wallet to another person unless you absolutely trust them

i had nothing to do with the million eca loss you are claiming and neither did electras codebase

accusing the entire project to be a scam is farfetched and unfounded

sir electra i had actually and naively left my trust to a pillar of the project to intervene on my wallet to insert a code because i could not stake must i remind you that this person is after you the main actor of the development of this project i have repeatedly asked you to intervene thing that you refused today so i feel that you are complicit in this scam unfortunately i am not the only one in this situation and i will remain here to denounce and warn investors of this scam all the time and years that will be necessary you can not steal people with impunity and continue without reprisals

i have been in contact with robert bakker of the electra foundation these past day they have come to the final stage of negotiations with a top exchange which has been operating since it is well known but i am not allowed to name it if i ask you to name two top exchange founded in that year you will probably guess it electra has passed all required criteria and the screening stage there is some extra funding needed to make it happen the electra foundation has set up a fundraiser here

i will also donate from private funds because it is one that i have always dreamed of seeing electra listed on in order to boost liquidity prestige and accessibility i commend the work the foundation and community have done in these negotiations

electra what contribution did you make to the donation is it okay for you to publish it




electra
may pm
i have already made a donation as it is from private funds i will not likely publish an exact figure or location just as no one else donating is required to

however it seems i need to give a ballpark figure because i have already gotten many enquiries about it the percentage of the current amount donated that is from me is greater than the percentage of total eca i control project funds included i hope this answer and amount will be sufficient

looking at the fact that the extra btc daily volume created by the NNOs surrounding the fundraiser is greater than the btc required i am confident we are on track to reaching the goal

n ovember am

well done and thank you for what you did irony

electra you are the biggest crook ever seen and you are not ashamed of anything

 you have never provided any work since and you are completely useless work not even the smallest thing

you have never participated or offered anything in years except thank us and you have just sold again the premine which was for the project supposedly for your own account

besides you had already sold a lot of the premine in altcoin and i have messages with you telling you not to buy shitcoin golem ect if it is for the project and you literally shit me on it in basically saying no i do what i want

in the end everything has fallen and you have no funds for the project after having massacred it with massive sales and you still continue to massacre it
you are the worst manager and you do not want to give custody to the foundation which has a legal entity
we have never changed or betrayed your trust in the code by blocking or recovering this premine but you dont respect anything

 they are not you funds but those of the premine for the project


unlike you i have worked all the time since on electra but its over well done for having us scam and i hope that you are indeed anonymous and that you did not leave a trace to find yourself for a jugementjustice

farewell
without any respect for you
robofus

electra
november pm
i would like to explain what led me to the decisions i took this past month firstly i must mention i have not done anything illegal or to my knowledge contradictory to any messages i have written previously i am also not anonymous an exchange leaked my identity years ago

ever since the largest funding for the project has been provided by me either directly or indirectly i have been directly involved in two vital hard forks and many exchange negotiations until asked to step aside

i am severely concerned that after multiple requests to the team over the past months i have not been shown the NNO code or been allowed to observe its progress the potential possibilities of what is being done with the code seriously worry me as i am not able to see the NNO code or who is working on it and therefore i do not know what direction the project is taking or what will change which is a very irregular position for a founder and primary donator to be put in it is a red flag for me and hence i took the decision to reduce the eca exposure of the funds i control the removal of this thread link my preferred line of communication from coinmarketcap a day after my previous post was also a factor in this decision i will scale back in when the uncertainty regarding the code no longer exists

there seems to be misconception about the definition of the premine which i should clarify the initial premine is as mentioned on day it is not as some people are insisting it is recorded in the blockchain unchangeable along with all expenditures which stand at hedge not included of which a least have gone to team and community projects i offered to give the remainder of the premine to the foundation after the team insisted but the offer got rejected and i was demanded to include the stakes and part with stakes are not premine

i have never guaranteed profits or told anyone to buy or sell electra in terms of transparency electra is in the top tier of the blockchain industry do not buy a cryptocurrency if you have concerns with it there are other options to choose from in usd terms an extremely high amount was invested into the development of the electra blockchain and it is one of the best out there today my issue is with the information being withheld from me and the teams uncompromising attitude towards me not the project itself



robofus
november pm
ts really upsetting how you feel about the whole project team spending weeks months and even years on this project havent you seen what has been done over the past years by these volunteers

by the way the code is not hidden at all everything can be seen through the github plus if youve ever read the media articles theyve highlighted multiple times and even disclosed potential improvements to come which could never be done without these guys who have always been loyal

you have to show your real intentions by redeeming the parts and sending them back to the premine with this the community will appreciate and understand your continued and honest support for your created project

are you brave enough to do this

electra november am
i am aware we have had great talent contribute to the project

github has the current version the upcoming code is in a private room i need to see the hot code and the discord discussion group for the NNO version please provide links if you have them so i can check them out pm if you want i dont mind


botero
november am
no seriously you still believe in these crooks little reminder i had million eca coin stolen from me certainly with the complicity of the founder and the socalled volunteers responsible for promoting this coin
they are not at their first scams
i have proof of what i put forward the exchange of messages that i had published on discord but of course they were deleted and i was banned
quit this shit and get on other much more serious projects there are so many



robofus november pm
the code is not in a private room no one has access to it everyone works alone and we can check it together once its done

this is the first time in years that you ask us for the code and that you use it as an excuse to sell the premine because you think we have something to hide

i dont understand how you can do this when we have always been transparent unlike you

first point you sold tons of electra from the premine on your own account without giving us any proof of txids of other blockchains altcoin adress proof of expense 

 second point you pretend that the stakes of the premine are not the premine and you say the foundation refuses your offer but accepting it would not have been honest because it is not what should be done

no one honest can say that the stakes of the premine does not belong to the premine for the project so change your mind today or assume being a scammer who will be judged for it

third point if you are so transparent why october did you sold huge amounts of electra from the premine you did not indicate anything here to be transparent

on november the foundation asked you why you sold the october you still sold huge amount of electra on november th and you answered afterwards because i dont trust the version code that is not shown to me

i repeat if you dont understand this code does not exist for anyone yet

and today november you still sell without saying anything
is that your transparency

so you sold several hundreds of million electra premine times in month under false statements and without any transparency your pretext its like asking to resuscitate a dead person or you sell the premine

i asked you to be brave enough to redeem and you deflect the problem

besides today can you give us a complete and precise inventory address and txid of the accounts of the premine since the old one is no longer up to date and you do not respect transparency

you should take me seriously and rebuy today the premine sold and be transparent

and if you decline and prefer to be publicly displayed as a scammer maybe it is time to reveal your full id eren Ö ive always kept my word and hope i dont need to say more


starsoul
november am
electra hi with respect and careful consideration contemplation i write this message to you as a long term holder of eca a community member that shared in the vision ethos of the project albeit as a simple investor too
 
it is a most unfortunate outcome that an entire team of good decent dedicated tirelessly hardworking people whom have in totality carried progressed evolved the eca project quite superbly over several years have now reached a decision to leave the project en masse frankly it would be reasonable to say it is a tragedy without being over dramatic at all nevertheless here we are

i see that nobody else has chosen to post here in your preferred forum of communication since the announcement made by the team yesterday yet i feel compelled to ask you a very simple question what are your intentions now regarding eca

it is said that everybody thinks they are correct and right from their own perspective alas inevitably whilst that might be true that very perspective that is held without having a truly balanced deeper consideration to a much bigger picture can and usually does lead to an outcome such as the current one regarding eca

imho we must should always feel compelled to gracefully generously authentically weigh up give credence value to the perspectives of others in order for equitable and satisfactory outcomes to be reached especially when there are thousands of people potentially affected this should be incumbent upon us unequivocally in all aspects of our decision making processes whereby what we choose to do can impact the lives of others in a myriad of ways consequences

rather than engage in mud slinging or vitriolic negativity lets please engage in the truth underpinned by integrity honesty i am sure you never imagined or envisioned back in that all these years later the current malaise would transpire so again i respectfully ask you where do you choose to go from here with eca a precise comprehensive answer from you whilst not demanded or expected it would i am certain be immensely appreciated by many people


thank you

electra httpsbitcointalkorgindexphpactionprofileu has been unmasked as the most deceivefull person we can imagine his only task was to gain only bitcoin by making false promises to the current team he used these funds for his own benefit to pay for his expensive lifestyle his own selfish character almost bomb the project to literally zero

please beware of this fraudulent person electra and dont believe a single word he is saying or trying to make you believe he discredited himself multiple times so this is a fair warning for the people from the future stay away dont believe electra he will serve you the cake but when you are not looking he will eat the cake himself and then try to convince you that you ate it yourself

the current team did the right thing by choosing for the future of the project and people around it eca is the past long live ecap




kxz november am yup 
fucking thief and scammer quietly selling premine to fuel his greed ecap is the way to go now



electra november pm





dear stakeholders

a couple of day ago some rogue user recklessly announced an unauthorized fork with unpublishedunreviewed code created fud and directly caused the price of eca to crash by which was the highest daily crash since the bonanza i anticipated a risk of such a move which is actually what provoked me to preemptively reduce my eca position i was not permitted to see the code or related discussions so i assumed a malicious move was imminent and i have been proven right i believe this move was going to happen whether i had scaled out or not but as a result of my actions they were forced to execute this plan quicker sadly i realized it too late to stop it completely

i am committed to eca and have taken steps to resolve the issue in a manner that will benefit current eca holders as a result of part of the team breaking off and creating a NNO fork and coin brand called ecap which will give a airdrop to most eca holders i have decided to take two drastic measures to attempt to preserve ecas unity stability and ensure it remains the primary chain in order to maximize the wealth of current holders firstly the foundation will have received all remaining premine by the time of this announcement secondly i will no longer control any stakes by the time of this announcement there were enough buy orders available to fully sell all eca staked holdings in multiple exchange in the past hours

by doing these actions i have kept my word by having the entire premine guaranteed for the project which preserves electras legitimacy and as stakes no longer exist in publically viewable accounts there will probably be no reason left for unnecessary wealthreducing splits ever again despite being out of all publicly viewable positions i will continue to write in this forum for electra as i currently have no significant holdings either chains performance will minimally affect me and if one version of the chain ceases to exist i will buy whichever one becomes the primary chain in the end it is up to the stakeholders the foundation and team to decide which will become the primary chain whichever chain prevails i accept the result and am glad it will finally resolve an issue that has dragged on for four years


i created a comparison table to help stakeholders decide on the primary chain

eca	ecap
	
no premine or stakes controlled by eo	no premine or stakes controlled by eo
existing foundation eca bonus	no foundation to fund project or if they pick ecap over eca they will lose ecap as donation was after nov
proven brand name	spinoff coin from main branch rarely succeed
multiple existing exchange	no exchange and will require thousands of usd to be gathered from stakeholders to get listed
eo has private holdings on nov	eo will get a airdrop on all private holdings that existed on nov
all infrastructure in place	will have to deal with getting into cmc and creating a block explorer etc
eo donated all premine to the project so all initial eo objectives are obsolete	eo received no airdrop for the premine so all initial eo objectives are obsolete
twitter and medium account owners defected to ecap	will start with a decent number of twitter followers and active medium page
unique code reviewed and published for public viewing	NNO unknownunproven code which is as of yet unpublished
established business partnerships	no partnerships


this table reflects the current situation and may change more people may join ecap or some may abandon ecap and return to eca ecap code may also be altered

november is the date of the snapshot for ecap anyone who had their funds on an exchange when the snapshot was taken will probably not be eligible for the airdrop


icathtrade
november pm
lets check this and have fun

announced an unauthorized fork with unpublishedunreviewed code

is there only one example since the blockchain technology exists that an open source code needs an authorization to be forked 

also i have read nowhere that the team will do a fork nore a swap it is explicit in their announcement that it is a NNO chain so NNO genesis block


i wanted to stop reading here cuz it was already funny enough

but i will prepare a detailed answer with proof of your lies wait a bit please 


electra

be my guest


robofus
november pm	 

 
some rogue user
are you talking about the volunteer team which did of the work and which created of the dev and social medias when you did and have nothing
that team that did all the work when you absolutely never did anything

its you the rogue

the team had to announce this unplanned airdrop because you do not respond and instead you were selling the project premine and you say you had to anticipate that by selling in advance best joke

why didnt you answer my questions and wait day without a response while you were still loging to sell the premine every day

why are you giving this money to the foundation when they have asked you this since it no longer has any interest or value everyone goes to ecap except you

why dont you donate the btc and altcoin from the premine to the foundation to pay t exchange to pay servers to pay integrations to pay development

why you always refused

why were you not transparent during the sales of the last day and avoid answering

why do you say that the stakes of the premine do not belong to the premine and therefore to the foundation when you said you should cover in and only need million at this price price lol so why did you sell million stakes for your personal account

very transparent and trustful 

httpsbitcointalkorgindexphptopicmsgmsg

why you lie and do not understand that no code is hidden neither eca nor ecap

the ecap code is under development and we had to announce a nonplanned snapshot in order to be able to block your rogue movements

how to say that the code is not verified if the ecap wallet does not exist

mostly i think you dont understand anything about code and blockchain reading your text it will be clear for everyone

you said you dont have a personal eca when we know you have now youre saying the opposite

and the problem on eca is not resolved since today on november you bought a lot of eca with btc obtained by illegally selling the premine

conclusion stay away from eca from now on and dont believe e never its a liar






icathtrade
november pm

thank you

first you didnt respond to this and i would like to understand you
then your comparison table

i want to mention that this is your point of view and of course you perfectly have full right to express it

and so my turn
 bellow from your statement listed to this form eca has xxx ecap has xxx



no premine or stakes controlled by e no premine or stakes controlled by eo

ok so we start by the biggest joke

why

 you sold all the premine in the shadow acting like any exitscam founders in crypto history

eg the last month since october 
your deposit address in coinfalcon the easiest to find from premine to an address to cold wallet of coinfalcon well known
 transaction and only the deposit addresses are used to access the cold
 
httpelectraexplorerinfoaddresseeuzhkxpnqtszzdzzzzkqbmpgznl

more than one billion you sent to this exchange and of course you didnt sold only here you are responsible of the go to in stex as well

remember this blockain never lies and we can track all until the genesis

ecaprotocol part true



existing foundation eca bonus no foundation to fund project or if they pick ecap over eca they will lose ecap as donation was after nov

well this is the most pathetic part of your post

foundation asks you since years to put the premine in hand of the only one legal entity of the project you always found excuses to not do it today we know why

how do you think it makes you looking you sold all as exit scam and in a last attempt to not consider yourself as a thief you sent a small part

ho important point a premine is a premine you have stacked the premine during a so long time against the request to stop this from the team and from the community
then you have decided that the stakes were suddenly your own coin how is it even possible to say this

ecaprotocol part you seem to not understand at all the term NNO chain and what it means for the project foundation



proven brand name multiple existing exchange spinoff coin from main branch rarely succeed no exchange and will require thousands of usd to be gathered from stakeholders to get listed

haaaa this is the first thing which makes sense congrats the eca part of this statement is correct

except than you forgot the community team and the community is the only reason for this which is for sure important to mention right

you have not contributed to the brands renown worst you tried to sink the project with your actions again today we know why

ecaprotocol part again this is one more proof that you didnt care at all of electra since the beginning saying such things its only because you have no clue on how the team manages the project if so you would not say such non sense
 


eo has private holdings on nov eo will get a airdrop on all private holdings that existed on nov

wow you think that the team who did everything since december has not managed this already
you really have a high opinion of yourself and a low one of the team

ecaprotocol part wait and see



all infrastructure in place will have to deal with getting into cmc and creating a block explorer etc

i cant believe what i read at this point it becomes clear that you really dont realize what you are writing

who created and host the explorer team
who created and host all rd parties interfaces team
who created and get the ownership of all the products team
who paid for all of this team

well it will be faster to do in the over way what do you have for electra

a weebly website and btc from selling premine of the project for your own interest did i forget something



eo donated all premine to the project so all initial eo objectives are obsolete eo received no airdrop for the premine so all initial eo objectives are obsolete

if you read all the above is it still necessary to talk about the first part

there is one super interesting thing you say here all initial eo objectives are obsolete

very strange as it was one of your excuses to not send the premine to the foundation because of your own roadmap

again again and again today we know why



twitter and medium account owners defected to ecap will start with a decent number of twitter followers and active medium page

second correct statement not bad

yes the community as told above is the main reason of the success of eca community created everything that exist and so are the owners


 
unique code reviewed and published for public viewing NNO unknownunproven code which is as of yet unpublished
 
yes 

this is what is called open source and the team can be proud of that
 
ecaprotocol part obviously you dont get this point either the NNO code for ecaprotocol is the v update which was supposed to be the NNO massive update of electra blockchain if you didnt destroy it all yes its not yet public as its still under development as ecaprotocol is an open source project as well everyone will have access to the code before the release able to compile by themselves fork update make change ect
basic crypto stuff
 

 
established business partnerships no partnerships
 
and we finish this by this wonderful statement which is also interesting in fact
 
what partnership do you have
what support do you provide for these partnership
whats your capacities to maintain this
 
from what we know as community your only act was to pay a dev to create electra back in from a fork of iceberg coin and hmmm nope thats good enough
 
i guess when you have writen this in your comparison table you must have exchanged eca and ecap probably
 
so far from what i have read all the partnerships follow the team in ecaprotocol as there are the ones who did everything since 
 

 

 
conclusion

i must confess that i used a funny tone to write this its dramatic enough as it is to make the drama even more dramatic

no one care of my own feeling but i will express it because this hurts me more than i want to admit

it would have been so simple to be part of the team as they requested to support the project you created back in 

its clear enough that you never expected electra to succeed as it did and you considered this i dont know like an experience

but even if it was an simple experience for you you were not allow to play with user money

think to that and about what you did



electra november pm
as i said before i kNNO a malicious move was coming and acted preemptively and made initial position reductions without announcement but transparently

the amount sent to the address you mention seems to be around million unless i am reading it incorrectly you are also not taking into account that large amounts of eca was withdrawn from exchange back to the public wallets and sent again a few day later i definitely did not sell million there i did not at any point during this year control more than million eca premine or stakes look at page of this address if you want to see examples of eca returning to the public wallets

httpsexplorerelectraprojectorgaddressejxiqybtyjvdnerltfdzmcgzcvz

while looking through the addresses to counter your argument i have actually come accross an anomaly the wallet containing this address on my desktop has eca in it but for some reason it says eca in the block explorer i will look into this

the other arguments you make are generally about what the team did versus me they did do a lot i never said i did all the work and gave credit as much as possible but i also made important contributions and major sacrifices for this project if some people want to start all over and pursue a NNO direction it is their choice

hi e it is hard for the community to know who is right or wrong however what is wrong is people who stored their eca on mobile and exchange are deemed as unloyal and wont receive the ecap airdrop

can you please advise your intention for eca you will still have a strong following eca will always be the NNO and main chain let us know if you will persists with eca and we the community will support it

robofus
november pm
hmmmm ecaforgottensupporters date registered today at pm

the mobile wallet will surely be eligible and the exchange it is impossible since e is hiding on it and the goal of ecap is to eliminate it to start again on a healthy basis


and for e 

lol you are really pathetic why do you only answer that

and youre lying again no action would have been done without the massive sales on your personal account

its as if thief steals and as an excuse when caught i stole because i kNNO the police were going to look for me
that does not make any sense

proof that we have acted urgently and that nothing is ready for ecap

when it comes to the anomaly you are the cryptos biggest noob it is necessary to rescan because all the addresses have a few of errors on the explorer

besides take the opportunity to explore it there will soon be more if you dont pay the servers

the team never did anything against you they could have hurt you and wouldnt have tried to talk to you trusting you
and you dare rogue insults amazing 

its very strange to see you so active now and to select the questions you want to answer
when it took you day to come forward during the sales and you still hadnt answered the questions by being logged in every day to sell

in conclusion again you avoid questions and you are a scammer


ecaforgottensuppor
november pm
yes i just registered an account as you guys keep saying to ask e directly on this forum i dont have an account here so of course i have to register

regarding mobile this is still being investigated and from the responses ive seen it would also seem impossible due to technical constraints

hence we are the forgotten supporters




robofus november pm
no worries but i want to stress it and again no we are still working on the mobile wallet it is not guaranteed yet but we are postponing the airdrop to successfully include the mobile

you can stay with e if you want but hes now alone of the team switches to ecap

ps can you tell us who you are on discord or telegram



ecaforgottensuppor november pm
fair enough hope mobile works out for many of us

we have spent lots of money investing in this coin so if we dont receive ecap then we have no choice but to support e

the ball is also in es court does he want to continue please just end this once and for all




robofus
november pm	 

chances are we can make the mobile wallet eligible i think you will have a choice 

if he wants to continue he should already answer all of the questions on the previous page instead of trying to avoid them

and your question is very interesting so im just waiting to see if he answers everything

but im afraid he wont do anything for electra like for years eca will die if there are no more developers and he seeks war there will be nothing left of eca

the website explorer mobile app access if we were as bad as e says we can all cut and kill electra by making it empty now already there is no longer any roadmap or developer

the team was respectful in the announcement of the airdrop ecap by suggesting that he continue if he wanted and he dares to insult rogue it could end badly if he continues this attack


electra november am

i have sent all remaining funds that were promised for the project to the foundation so the community and foundation can freely decide on how to operate the funds from now on and what objectives to pursue the real question is if the foundation will decide to stay with eca or not and it is something i am completely unsure about if they do not stay with electra i do not know what they will do with the eca funds that is something they will have to answer and please do ask them because it will have an effect on which chain they decide to support they will have more funds if they stay with electra and lose half if they switch to ecap but i am not sure if this is an important incentive for them of not as far as the foundation tells me it will be around a week before they announce which chain they will support


i am guessing the airdrop will happen because everyone loves free coin but to come to the level electra already is at will take a lot of extra investment work and time on their part and they will also start with less funding

i am obviously sentimental towards eca and if the foundation announces they are with the electra project it will have a good harmonious future that will include me as an advisor and contributor i am also very appreciative of the support you offer



electra
november am
i did not intend rogue as an insult i dont think i have ever insulted a team member






pn
november am
the team said they know that e still has about billion eca in private wallets and they expect ecap to have about billion less supply after the airdrop herere my observations

 the team have intentionally planned to reduce supply by billion at the expenses of people who have eca on exchange that is their ultimate goal not just to get rid of e the team also mentioned that e has about million eca in cryptopia which is a fraction of about billion eca that belong to many holders their justification is that its technically impossible to airdrop to user who will receive eca back from cryptopia in the near future the fact is cryptopia keeps eca in only a few accounts and anyone can see them from the block explorer if the team really dont know how to airdrop to user who will get their eca back from cryptopia then how can anyone trust them to develop a crypto project 

 the team said that they know which private wallets belong to e so he wont be able to get ecap airdrop
 if they can really prevent e from getting airdrops from these accounts why they need to exclude exchange accounts from the airdrop
 if they cant then whats the point of the airdrop because e will get ecap airdrop anyway

 if e really has only billion eca left whats a big deal its not unusual for a billion supply project to have whales with billion or more its crypto and people dump all the time are they going to do another airdrop if they find out that someone has more than billion ecap in the future for whatever conflicts the team have with e dont use it as an excuse to take away investment from those who also spent money to buy eca

 the team said they airdrop ecap for free so people who have their eca in exchange accounts wont lose anything if you read in the discord you will see that community members who will benefit from the loss of others and some of the team members are wishing eca to disappear after the airdrop the team is even taking away the social media and a lot of supporters from eca they know really well that their intention is to leave eca project to die people who trade eca on exchange accept the risk that exchange may get hacked but coinfalcon doesnt get hacked and cryptopia will return about billion eca to account holders in the near future people are not losing their investment because of the malicious hack but because of the teams decision to exclude exchange accounts from the airdrop the malicious act in this case is indeed done by the team

btw dont tell me that the qtwallet runners are more important than others they run node because they get staking rewards that others dont

if you got to social media that the team has total control you will see a lot of flattering posts by those members who cant wait to benefit from the loss of others for those members who complained about unfairness they mostly have been banned and their posts were removed just go to ecap twitter account you will see how people really feel about this airdrop httpstwittercomelectracoinecastatus

team members always say that they have worked for free most of them hold a lot of eca and they will benefit from the increase of coin value stop pretending to be the saviors you guys are just upset because you havent gotten compensated enough for what you guys have done

 for those who think about buying ecap please run away from it as you can the ecap scam will fail miserably because it has bad intention from the start this project starts by stealing investment from innocent people in order to reduce the total supply it will go nowhere and is a scam even before it starts 

what a shame

e

first and foremost yes this is my first post however i have watched this project since 

secondly with your sudden interest in responding and becoming increasingly more active it has become quite apparent that you are either worried or pissed off beyond any level you have ever experienced before it could be both yet you cannot contain your emotions which is causing you to slip up and make irrational statements to which will allow all to piece this puzzle together until then just remember this when you pray for rain youve got to deal with the mud too

rm





electra november am
my activity has increased in response to the higher number of posts than usual and because it is a critical month for the project i do try to remain objective in my responses but some emotion is likely to slip out from time to time if you have the time pm me which statements you considered irrational and i will try to reword them into a more rational state

you have decided to answer only one selected question it makes sense because you just cant say much on all of this

about your answer on this only point we say exactly the same thank you we talk about sending huge amount of premine to exchange

i advise everyone to read my first comment then the answer both quoted above and get your own opinion on e capacities



robofus
november am
its wonderful you always avoid the most important questions and told that you are more active because of the increased activity

yet even when there was only one message you did not reply
you could have explained yourself before as long as it was possible to save eca instead of continuously selling the premine without answering

too late now





juste

you only sent a fraction of the total premind e everyone knows the power of the blockchain

cf exchange deposit address of e direct deposit from premine wallet httpelectraexplorerinfoaddresseeuzhkxpnqtszzdzzzzkqbmpgznl

 more than billion but you send only mil one day ago to the foundation

this confirms that you are trying to be the good guy but you arent
such a noob

ps
made a bt account specially just to reply for your crap on a beautiful sunday

dima november pm
e lets assume the following scenario

the foundation decides to give up the project and is dissolved the funds held will be returned to you the creator of the project
what happens after that
will you lead the project as creators or do we have to assume that the project will be buried
please answer the question explicitly

as we know you acted out of premonition and sold preminestake funds before anything happened
please state what happens to the currency you received for the sale

what would happen to it if ecap hadnt come about


electra
november pm
i have already replied to a similar statement made a few posts ago


electra november pm

if the foundation is dissolved and funds returned to me then the project will go back to the initial objectives listed in the op

premine is for the project stakes are not if ecap hadnt come about this would have still been the case



robofus november pm
why are you still ignoring the questions it doesnt work in public and you prove to be a scammer and manipulator

for example

why do you say that the stakes of the premine do not belong to the premine and therefore to the foundation when you said you should cover in and only need million at this price price lol so why did you sell million stakes for your personal account

httpsbitcointalkorgindexphptopicmsgmsg

ps if you take over the foundation you will have to show yourself publicly dont forget that many people expect that from you 




electra november pm
funds returning to me from the foundation is unlikely

article dissolution

 after dissolution the foundation will remain until the finance balance is 

 if the foundation has a surplus on the finance balance the remaining finances must be spent on the sustainability of the foundation where possible

	





robofus
november pm
you must have missed my message again surely a coincidence every time you avoid answering this question you make your case worse

in your last answer you also forget to answer that


robert mccall november pm
so do you anticipate carrying eca forward even if the foundation dissolves



dima november pm

it looks like the foundation will be dissolved and you as the founder will get the premine back if no NNO members are found
httpstwittercomecafoundationstatuss

you say eca will stick to the old goals

who will take care of the project
who will develop further
who will pay for and maintain the infrastructure

i ask for a transparent contribution or you come online in telegram discord to talk to the community in real time

allow me to quote some part of the eca foundation statement which you can find here httpselectrafoundationmediumcomfoundationstatementwithregardstorecentdevelopmentswithintheecaprojectbbeaf

the statutes also state that all eca members can apply to become a board member if you are interested in this position you can email us at foundationelectraprojectorg please be aware that one of the criteria to become a board member is that physical identification at a dutch notary is mandatory

so i would like to see this project continue and than may compete with ecap would the best survive i will hodl both

and here we are what had to happen happened
i carried this project for over a year during my disappointment i thought i could count on either the socalled community or at least on those who formed the foundation but unfortunately my hopes are quickly dashed when e in the exchange we had he literally despised me
while it is eca ecap and maybe tomorrow another split an ecap i take no risk to say that the mass is done and still hundreds of investors who will be plucked
what a waste but we could expect better with this bunch of opportunists



dima december am
you are forking all electra stuff from github but you cant reply here


electra
december am
forking electra was a big priority if the current code was hidden from me the project would have died for sure

i will pay for the NNO critical infrastructure if needed

my initial objectives are almost finished when they are i will not have additional goals

if NNO replacements are chosen in the foundation i will very likely accept that they stay in charge of the funds if the foundation is dissolved i will use the funds to pay for the NNO infrasructure and complete the objectives if any funds remain after the objectives are complete i will give a grace period of months for a NNO foundation to be set up and if a NNO foundation is not set up i will assume the user are not interested to take the project further and will donate the rest of the premine to charity and provide evidence of it


ecapscam
december am
so it seems like little progress is being made with regards to making things right for the investors this feud between the two sides has left many investors with nothing and a project that has been stolen away from them to claim that this other project is NNO is laughable it is literally everything that eca was and promised to be it is simply a slight rebranding with everything else being the same

there are options available to make the situation right and they know it it is simply a matter of taking action

as an investor it is quite confusing having eca and ecap with the founder and team being divorced and so forth it is best that the team create or rebrand ecap into something different if eca continues to remain exist and people wants to buy ecap it may cause confusion instead of buying ecap ended up buying eca since it is still electra ended up asking can it be swapped since it is still electra same goes for website flow people searching for electra and electra protocol site visits that pops out automatically visiting the wrong site just by searching electra moreover not everyone is on social medias upon seeing their investment on eca plummet the same thing people will be asking in the future as it is still eca with a p any problem coming from electra will still lead to ecap

the community and team needs to inject some creativity to rebrand into a fresh start call for some submission naminglogo and the team should be the judges to decide as community tend to create different accounts and vote for it to get what they want but the team is the one carrying the name seeking for partnerships etc the team will decide which to carry as long not sticking back to electra ive seen projects that is doing very well after rebranding leaving the past behind and moves forward there are so many forks out there and the name totally changed but technology is like continues to upgrade even better with different fork just leave the black history behind and move forward this is going to be a long and dramatic argument as there is no transparency

as for my investment in eca its all down the drain and i do not trust the market that could possibly be manipulated by the founder e since the team have been the ones that are doing most of the work up until now it is best that you have full control over the brandfunds that youre looking in the future years to come was planning to integrate electrapay for my company but now looking at electra is just so traumatizing just let go of the name electra and put it in archive


electra
december pm
the other side is welcome back anytime but at this stage from the attitude they are showing i assume they will continue with ecap and therefore i must ensure eca is prepared for the transition which i anticipate will be smooth the current eca stakeholders should assume that the upgrade to v will not go ahead for eca as it is now intellectual property of ecap and so eca will remain on the current chain investors should also assume that electrapay which was an initiative of the former team will not be supported for eca in the near future unless an agreement is reached with the ecap team



robofus
december pm
the team and the devs migrate everything that was planned to ecap so no electrapay for eca but just for ecap

regarding your roadmap its interesting because you havent done anything since and if this roadmap has no other objectives which will be added in the future we can consider the eca as dead

if you want to escape after finishing your roadmap you could have participated more actively with motivated and passionate devs instead of selling and being quiet and doing nothing

i will not stop repeating my last message until i have an answer rd time 

why do you say that the stakes of the premine do not belong to the premine and therefore to the foundation when you said you should cover in and only need million at this price price lol so why did you sell million stakes for your personal account
httpsbitcointalkorgindexphptopicmsgmsg




electra december pm
i get your point and now understand where the issue is stemming from the first sentence is poorly worded the word capital is very general it is wrong to assume only finance capital other capital types that may apply are individual capital and intellectual capital along with others

investment also has multiple definitions
the action or process of investing money for profit
an act of devoting time effort or energy to a particular undertaking with the expectation of a worthwhile result

i invested a lot of my individual finance and intellectual capital into the project for the past four years the stakes compensate me for this







icathtrade
december pm
the only thing you did is spend the premine when you have accepted to

you paid server you paid website you didnt participate to the calls you didnt participate to the project management at all

individual finance intellectual how dare you

you were not active at all how dare you say this

asmoth master den ruru jenova nashclay greg robert bob and others

these guys did all what exist today in electra they are the ones who made electra a known brand

they are the only one



robofus

this answer is such a joke 
you havent done anything you havent updated your weebly website roadmap since 

you have no intellectual or blockchain knowledge

you only think about your profit without ever participate to the project you were really totally useless finance intellectually and individually

you simply take advantage of the naivety of the user to dump on them

it is for this reason that i ask you to find a solution to resolve this issue and return all stolen btc altcoin to the community you can send me a private message if you are really looking for a solution

eren this is your last chance as you said you are not unknown otherwise then when certain things are done there is no return
i hope you take me seriously and realize the bad things you have done

dude you dont have a clue either this eca team who were earlier considered white knights are a bunch of scammers who are trying to profit on the expenses of several user who had their wallets locked in cryptopia that is very dirty way to suddenly drive the price of you ecap token just excluding bi coin just on topia calling all holdrs fuckin traders who want to dump eca and banning everyone who dares to complain on ecas channels ecap or whatever name you those guys decide to call it already born very bad thats an abort


robofus
you pretending to be someone youre not aman and with an account that has just been created date registeredtoday at pm
exchange cannot be eligible due to eren e hidden there for cryptopia you may never get your eca back with the cost of liquidation
if you deposit everything you own on an exchange its a risk and im sorry for you

otherwise the volunteers have no advantage in excluding the community we could very well give up everything for everyone for example create a NNO project from with an ico and without airdrop
and unlike eren we never steal or manipulate

aman sin
december am
 i am not pretending to be anyone and i am not aware about any other aman sin here
 i cant understand the issue on creating an account today i can do it again tomorrow and so on since ecas team are banning from channels on the first complain from exchange holders
 the coin on cryptopia are fully returning to its owners without costs yes billion of eca will be useless due the team blocking it from the airdrop
 you dont need to say sorry about topia my coin are there they were not hacked they will return in this very coming months it better to say sorry about team decision ironically
 yes the team and indirectly the owners have a lot of advantage excluding billions of eca stored in exchange decreasing supply and increasing ecap value its not magic
 i am even not retard to respond about your last issue or maybe i should respond go on lets see what happens what kind o credibility these names could have just giving up from this projectthe truth is team hide themselves behind this doing it for free mask while everyone knows most of them are bonanza whales cmon man up



robofus
december am
 there is already an aman singh hence my remark
 you could have registered here since and here you will never be banned
 the eca do not change if e who is the founder of the project continues you can work with him
 if youre sure to get them back you should be happy nothing changes for eca just volunteers cannot continue with work e but e can continue with other people
 what you said is wrong if that was what we wanted we have more to gain from doing an ico since and no airdrop
 how can you say that the team are bonenza whales when of the team except me arrived months after the bonenza 

the only person who abandoned the project is the person responsible for the destruction eren e you can check his activities on bitcointalk and you will see that he was never there except to thank the volunteers once a year and he never answered questions when it mattered as i proved in a screenshot a few pages before

and as you can see i am not in the eca project anymore but i am more active than eren on this topic you should be asking yourself the right questions if youre not a troll

very important announcement

dear stakeholders

the servers controlled by former team member jenova contain the seed node for ellipal the mobile wallets and support electrapay and all thirdparty wallets they will be shut down permenantly in a few dayhours i have not been given a specific date as of yet which means eca in mobile wallets and ellipal will freeze unless you convince him to reopen the servers for you he did kindly offer to keep servers running for btcmonth but i have concluded that btcyear would be an unsustainable cost for the eca project and therefore service for ellipal mobile wallets electrapay and all thirdparty wallets will be discontinued the moment servers are cut desktop and exchange wallets will still function as far as i am told by jenova

he is generously keeping the servers open for the time being so user do not have their eca frozen but i recommend you to withdraw your eca to a desktop or an exchange wallet as soon as possible after server support is cut do not send any eca to ellipal or mobile wallets desktop and exchange wallets will be the best places to keep your eca at this point

what remains is the block explorer and website i will continue them but i am deciding whether to maintain the current ones on jenovas servers or create NNO ones to host personally you will be informed further as soon as i decide

please share this message with as many user as possible i will also ask the ecap team to share this and hopefully they will i want all eca holders to read this message i do not want anyone left behind therefore the bitcointalk thread will be locked for the next day to ensure as many people see this message as possible without the clutter of additional messages if you have any queries pm me in bitcointalk and i will get back to you

damn he did but just like him im not a man of my word plus that m are from staked coin from a wallet that i dumped so what is remaining is rightfully mine


altinvestordecember pm
anybody who trusts the team and supports ecap is either insane or completely stupid 
theyre starting off their NNO coin by stealing the assets of eca
as much as e dumping his coin yes his robert was very clear that this was a known factor back in read back through the posts in july of was horrible and hurt everyones values at least he didnt steal anything belonging to anyone else hes always been open about the fact that the staking on the premine was his it would be more commonly known if the team hadnt accused everyone of fud and belittled everyone who ever brought it up 
theres been multiple big sells over the years but for some reason the team decided with this one to quit and start their own conveniently eliminating a whole bunch of the community from their planned airdrop while using the community as justification to out and out steal assets from eca
the foundation board who constantly and continuously advertised how much safer and more official the foundation made eca are actively openly participating in this espionage
and while theyre openly stealing assets and hurting people theyre saying trust us again oh and cant forget everyone just has to trust that none of the team sold anything i guess were also just supposed to trust that none of them moved their coin from an exchange to their wallet before the snapshot was taken if the team wants trust they should provide their wallet addresses so everyone can go through their transaction just like they demand of e yeah its private but so are the stakes theyre screaming about that e sold how do we know that none of them were doing exactly the same thing
even without all the reasoning from e the teams excuses stink its pretty obviously just a way to give themselves a bigger premine for expenses and lower the coin supply by however many poor victims have coin on an exchange
ei have no respect for how you chose to sell your eca but that was and always has been an option available to you it was a despicable move but not blatantly dishonest 
the team the foundation though blatantly dishonest im surprised theres nothing written into the foundation about espionage by board members

it is what it is 


 i made a shittonne of money from this project the hour mining bonanza i rented hash on nicehash for it 

 i lived comfortably off electra for years literally it all went to shit in the end but i had close to billion coin from day of mining i live in a bedroom flat i had rigs of my own only then the stake rewards were amazing eca coin peaked hard at round sats mid 

 it was obvious it wasnt gonna last it was too good to be true for some people 
 
 i had nothing to do with the project i was just a miner who liked the idea of the bonanza and fuck yes it was worth it 

 sorry to see it go this way but massive thanks to the electra project for changing my life 



 nothing really surprises me in the crypto space anymore might be the time to buy eca at th of a satoshi surley it can only go up again i sold all but million coin before this happened sold my last batches at sats im buying some back for less than of what i sold the last for investing based on pure maths whats to say all this isnt just a scam

 drop value of current eca coin with fud for accumulation before pumping it again and in the process get a whole NNO coin out of it good deal lol

well as long as nobody is going to pick up the project it cant go far the team that was formed out of a supporting community has left to a NNO coin called electra protocol with the ticker xep

the NNO founder was not very active for a long time

so who is going to go forward with it without active people no way to the moon

january pm
in my experience for an altcoin to truly die or be close to death one of the following must happen
 no one miningstaking so the blockchain stops
 consistently usd daily volume or getting delisted from all exchangecoinmarketcap
 a big error in the code that no one bothers to fix
 cease and desist orders from the usa targeting a specific altcoin
 source code and wallet downloads becoming inaccessible to user

as long as these do not happen the project will be alive the first year electra was founded we came close to and but remained alive nonetheless and on top of that for reasons still unknown to me pumped x in a month some people consider code updates necessary for the survival of a coin but there are successful coin out there like dogecoin that do not update the code frequently electras code is unique among altcoin due to the consensus mechanism that does not exist in any other project

bear in mind competition is much fiercer when electra was created there were around coin and now there are many with usd budgets time will tell how electra will fare for me electra is in the same league as blackcoin peercoin litecoin maxcoin icebergcoin and boolberry etc the league of nd generation bitcoin based altcoin with one or more unique features some have obviously fared better than others

as said beforeyou are looking on instructions from electraprotocolthis is xep coin something completely different
you need to go to electraprojectorg and check there for eca related issues or contact the owner of ecae

well although you took your information from the electraprotocol website they seem correct as well for electra

what idont know as i never used ellipal is in what way you have been able to extract the private key if you enter a correct eca private key in to an electrawallet it should show in the selection of wallets for deposits the address should show if it doesnt match there must be something wrong with your private key or you might check with the explorer if the coin are still on that address

dear e

my ecas are stuck on my mobile wallet and i cannot send them to all desktop or exchange

could you please help solving this problem
making the mobile wallets work again

thanks in advance



dk january pm
hello
you are lucky my coin stuck in blockchain and nobody help me keep calm and search
i try to solve my problem and nobody help me and not understand why
i dont know why i think the xep project will go to zero and the eca project will last over time if the team is rebuilt
probably our problems will be solved when the team is rebuilt and we will have more support
i say wait and be patient i dont know why i believe in this project but thats how i feel


goodhabit
january pm
well there are very few people here so even if someone has some knowledge it will take time until your problem will be noticed

i dont actually get what you mean with stuck in blockchain since your last question i looked up the webpage of ellipal and if i understood correctly they dont actually offer an option to extract your private key if you really have your private key it should be a character word starting wit qq if you have something different its not your electra private key
if it is however than you should be able to import it in to your electracore wallet

btw eca is still listed on ellipals website as supportedso it is a problem between you and ellipal either they have to make their app again working on the electra blockchain or they have to provide a way to extract your private key so my tip contact ellipal support

january pm
hello
first i want to write all story in detail
i buy electra from exchange in transaction
also after that i send to my eca account from ellipal
after that ellipal block all eca account
after ellipal block all eca acoount i write to ellipal and with help from ellipal i extract from my device private key
so in this moment i have private key and private key start with qq and have characters and adress of my eca wallet
i say my coin stuck in blockchain 
yes i see my coin because i verify transaction and coin is now in my eca wallet so my coin is in my wallet ellipal wallet but my wallet is block
in this moment eca ellipal wallet show coin but coin is in my eca wallet if i search after adress on httpsecaccoreonline

after that i ask on discord telegram reddit reddit do not post my questions i write to eca i write to ellipal and all say to me to install eca desktop wallet and follow steps from this link

httpslearnelectraprotocolcomdocspaperimport

note
i install eca desktop wallet
i sync eca desktop wallet
i use command like in link httpslearnelectraprotocolcomdocspaperimport
and i can not import my coin

after that i write to eca ec from here and i receive this message

firstly make sure the desktop wallet is fully synced
electra no longer supports ellipal wallet as you have probably found out the ellipal app holds your coin so it is ellipals responsibility to help you on this have you tried contacting them and asking how you can import the ellipal private keys to your eca wallet i have never imported a private key from ellipal myself so can only provide limited advice
downloading the desktop wallet and typing in the console were right moves but there may be another command that needs to be written and only ellipal can tell you this
electra is bitcoin based so commands are the same as they are for bitcoin i have shared the link to their guide on importing private keys
httpsenbitcoinitwikihowtoimportprivatekeys

after this message i write to ellipal and ellipal write me this message
hello there
you can go to the app and import an account with mnemonics and pass phrase after that you will get a hot wallet account
and then go to the account settings export the private keys choose eca
and import the private key on an exchange a wallet that support eca coin

from this i block and i do not how to do to recover my coin

so in my eca desktop wallet do not work to import follow step from link httpslearnelectraprotocolcomdocspaperimport in exchange like say ellipal i dont know how can do this and what exchange accept this type of transaction
another method like say ec downloading the desktop wallet and typing in the console were right moves but there may be another command that needs to be written and only ellipal can tell you this electra is bitcoin based so commands are the same as they are for bitcoin i have shared the link to their guide on importing private keys httpsenbitcoinitwikihowtoimportprivatekeys i not understand how can do that

in finaly what can do now
i wait to somebody help me if know how to solve the problem




goodhabit
january pm
well the question i see here is could you use the process that you received from the ellipal support as this was the method to get the private key if yes importing should work if it doesnt its either the wrong key as you did something wrong or there are multiple keys and you would have to check try which one is for the address that holds your coin or the process described by ellipal doesnt work so again you would have to check with their support

otoh as far as i understand the ellipal manual you could also enter your mnemonic in to the mobile ecawallet and this would work if and thats the big if those will ever work again

anuary pm
hello
i trust ellipal and i have a good private key i m sure for that 
yes i discover private key with ellipal support ellipal support answer me only on email in maximum hrs
probably i think for eca support is hard to answer and solve problems in a short time for holders probably until he solves the problems with those who left the team
by the way i believe in the electra project in this phase and i hope to solve my problem as soon as possible

what i cant understand at the moment is why the team left and left a project that had everything it needed to climb to the top i think the electra manager is in a difficult situation at the moment its just my point of view right now i dont know why but i have more confidence in the electra project than in the NNO xep project at the moment
thanks for all for the moment



dk january pm

i have tried to convince the electra foundation to stay open for now and all eca funds are still there ready for anyone from the eca community to control if they apply as board members any user interested in applying to the foundation is welcome to and will have to travel to the netherlands to complete the process i will aim to keep it open until around august but how long it stays open also depends on the mercy of the former board members


as i have written many times before electra is a decentralized project this has benefits but also consequences the electra project github page was owned by members of the current xepformer eca team i found out today that the page including all source code wallets and whitepaper have been deleted luckily i anticipated this risk and migratedbackedup all of this to the former NNO electra github page a few weeks ago the op in this thread contains all updated links for the wallets source code and whitepaper cmc links will be updated in the coming day i have also been forced to hastily create a NNO website as the old one also belongs to a former team member who has decided to delete all content on the website i was warned about that beforehand at least the NNO electra website is humble but does the job and is safer than a conventional website electracoreweeblycom


i condemn these hostile moves by the xep team even though there are also certain people in the xep team i consider decent and have no issues who are always welcome back in eca the pages were deleted without informing me and had i not backed these up eca would have been dead and everyones holdings doomed this is one of the lowest acts i have seen in the cryptocurrency sector they need to remember that a lot of people who got the xep airdrop also still own eca and attempts to sabotage eca hurts both xep their own community and eca holders the xep team has again demonstrated publically that they use the word community for marketing only and not in actuality they are willing to damage and destroy the holdings of multiple communities and user for negative feelings they harbor for one person that github page was maintenance free so to take the effort to log in there and delete it is not a costsaving act but a malicious one i have never in my life seen people delete source code to sabotage all holders of a specific coin as said in the previous paragraph i luckily backed it up and released it in the op


i have looked at the xep block explorer and block and have strong opinions on the distribution method and invite everyone to look at it also and do their own due diligence if you want to invest inhodl a coin where certainall team members have a track record of abandoning projectsinvestors losing user funds lying blackmail deleting source code wallets and critical user comments then xep is a good choice xep was premined and has more premine and total supply than eca ever had all premine is again controlled by one person who is also currently deciding who gets an airdrop and who doesnt i believe everyone who applied will get the airdrop but there is also a risk certain team members will get a lot more xep than their NNO eca holdings because it will be easy to mask it depends on how the person in charge of the xep distributes it i suggest all to watch that number closely as it is an intimidating amount after the there is also an additional billion premine that is held by one person and it is already fully mined on the xep rich list it says it will come in etc but it is already out and ready to use after the airdrop is distributed assuming the unclaimed amount is burned accurately i estimate their premine will account for approximately of the total supply this whole ecaxep drama began over eca and the ethical solution the team has offered is premined xep a billion premine that can be airdroppeddistributed manually however they want congratulations to everyone who will get the airdrop you will make money wherever the price goes because you had no entry cost i wont go as far as speculating on my predicted price but i would rather bet on a horse race than buy xep at the ieo price


dk anuary pm
hello electra

electra please go ahead with the electra eca project i have personally studied and talked to several people about xep and it seems to be a big scam i personally believe in the electra project and i assume that you have big problems with the continuation of the project at this moment until everything is set up as it was until some time ago a saying goes that whoever betrays once will do it a second time my opinion is to stop looking back and move forward as fast as you can and put everything back together so that you can continue the electra project personally i think you will succeed were moving forward with you god help


by the way today after i finally managed to retrieve the coin and have them in my desktop wallet i managed to do pos but that stopped at one point displaying in the lower right corner the message stacking is not active multisend active 
is it the error considering what happened
does stacking have anything to do with whats going on
because if so this has to do with the bad things that the xep team does it seems to me the lowest thing
im just asking

thanks

january pm	 


you foolish scammer everything is transparent and everyone can check that trough the transparency of the blockchain like the team did with your premind holdings that belonged to the foundation but what you did sneaky dumping the premind you e could be the nakamoto of eca but nooyou choose the other way to grab a few xxx winnings for your own benefits across the back of the best hard working team you ever crossed eren Ö you made the the wrong decision and the community feels your pain no one wants your foundation lol get over with




aman sin january pm
cmon e you definitely dont need those people they still dare to call it a community project but they are profiting on the back of every single owner who can not get the airdrop scumbags total scumbags during all this time playing the good guys full of moral values lol more and more people starting to realize how dirty they are
they just shot themselves in the foot

cause my eca are gone now stuck somewhere

there is no need to pretend to be a user lol come on e you lost your chances so deal with it

hahahahah i am actually a user you made me laugh anyway i bought most of my eca at sat



youpicoin

just think about the fact that you bought them from e as he might have been selling his eca all along the years to finally dump the premine instead of supporting the foundation e is really thankful to you
hope you applied for the airdrop




loweyboy
january am	 

e will just drag this out like he did with his promise to send the remainder of the premine to the foundation which never happened all the time dumping eca to buy back lower as he always has done well congratulations you got your wish you can buy as much as you like now that its worth next to nothing i hope you are happy with your last years efforts
anyone hoping that this habitual liar will resurrect eca project is going to be sorely disappointed
prove me wrong


youpicoin january am quotelayarak cevaplıyor
thank you for title announcements from xep team sounds much more professional

i am really wondering who you tried to convince and how 

you anticipated nothing you have been warned enough in advance you took the right action to backup the data

eca would have been dead and everyones holdings doomed even if you say eca is not dead ecas holding are worthless fortunately xep airdrop is the right alternative and permit to do not take into consideration anymore the holdings of eca anyway if by any matter eca recovers it will be a chance for eca holders who also took advantage of xep
this is one of the lowest acts i have seen in the cryptocurrency sector you dumped premine come on you dumped eca since years wow
you have the source code juste create another github page upload it and stop crying

laughing out loud lol 
i think point of view isnt the same xep project is not abandoned but continues eca seems to be abandoned by its founder anyway
where is the problem with xep is premined as it will have maybe the best distribution a crypto ever had 

again do you really one person controls the premine i am the premine is multisig hope xep team will announce it or i might have missed it xep learned a lot with you they will not reproduce the same mistakes

that is true i do not know why you keep saying one person there are more that person performing the checks regarding the airdrop and i personaly believe in them unlike in you

false multisig not held by one person lol

again lol there is already an estimate of the NNO distribution and you are far from that ratio i am just wondering how you estimating your numbers without concrete information nevertheless just wait beginning of feb to have the final numbers

the m xep sat has been eat
eca is now traded sat on hitbtc
moreover there is something far more annoying that the m drama you are mentioning your ethical behavior

good afternoon in the electra wallet it is written that day are behind in the scan block that is the network has closed how can i turn it on or resume


goodhabit
january pm
you still have this problem because day behind only means that your wallet is not fully synced so you do have actual connections if you dont you might try the addnode xxxxxxxxxxxx add comand using addresses from the explorer

glad to see that your problem was solved although i would never have suggested that you need to unlock your wallet before importing your private key because that seemed to obvious

the rather more interesting question is how did you get your private key from ellipal

im actually only asking out of technical curiosity because i have neither coin on ellipal nor on a electramobile app but may be a solution could be of interest to people who have their coin stuck on mobile electra wallets unless until they come eventually online once again

i know that coinomi offers a link to a tool that allows to extract private keys if you only know the mnemonic tried this with the mnemonic from my empty android electra wallet now the tools supports many coin but not explicitly electra so i looked if from adressformat private key format another coin would come very close indeed the result for einsteinium looked like an electra address both address format and privatekeyformat but unfortunately i couldnt find my ecaaddress from the mobile wallet on that list although i could import that private key in to the electrawallet and it was accepted as belonging to the same address as on the list so the format including formula for privatekeyaddress generation seems to be identic between eca and einsteinium

so the question how to extract a private key from ellipal just for fun i donwloaded the ellipal app as well insertet the same mnemonic selected eca as coin and received an address but unfortunaltely again not the same as on my mobileelectra wallet and of course i couldnt find any information in the ellipal app or on the ellipal webpage how to get the privatekey for that address

so the question how did you get your correct electraprivate key out of ellipal might really be of interest to several electraholders with coin on their mobile wallet



robert mccall

if i had a mic right now i would pass it to you so that you could drop it

hello

i hope to help
if it is necesary i write here my corespondence with ellipal team

exporting private keys from ellipal works ok but unfortunately not from electramobilewallet

ive been a bit to lazy to look true all options on the ellipalapp but with the instructions in the post just above extracting a private keyfrom an electraaddress on ellipal and importing it into the electracorewallet works just fine

as most informations about using mnemonic codes stipulate that mnemonics of the same length should work on all devices using mnemonic codes so that you just could use any other app that supports your specific coin and restore your wallet using the mnemonic and ellipal states this expressively on its webpage i was hopeful that the ellipal app might provide a solution for the user of the electramobile wallets as the ellipal app allows you to export your private keys create a paperwallet while the electraapp doesnt or i have been unable to find out how and as their is no support

but unfortunately using the same mnemonic on the electraapp and the ellipal app doesnt produce the same address so you cant restore the coin on your electramobilewallet on the ellipalapp

how can this be the only explanation is that the electraapp uses a nonstandart procedure to generate addresses from the mnemonic if this is really the case launching an app that doesnt allow to extract private keys was always a bad idea and in that case ending server support on a rather short notice is even worse










dk january pm
hello

yes i wrote about ellipal it is somehow normal that it is not the same private key that corresponds from ellipal to the one from the electra application mobile wallet there are two different applications though i hope the post is ok and helps you it took me a while to do this and now im done i hope to help others




goodhabit
january pm	 

well its actually not normal because all information about using mnemonics always states that whatever the app all mnemonics of a certain length and with the same base language should always produce the same root key and from there derrive the same privatekeys and walletaddresses ellipal explicitly states that it can be restored on any other device using the standard format for mnemonics

im not actually looking for help for myself because i never held eca on mobile electra wallet or ellipal i was just wondering trying to help because i did read a lot about people frustrated by the fact that the mobile electra wallet isnt supported anymore and therefore looking for a solution

but thank you anyhow

just wanted to say that eca is available in atomicdex httpsatomicdexio both mobile and desktop version so you have a wallet with an integrated atomic swap dex
